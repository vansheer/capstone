0,"A little bit of a slow start, but you came back strong in the end"
0, What do you think was the key to turn it around
0,"Well, yeah, it was a really tough start"
0, I think she started playing really solid and I was bit in and out with my attitude and with my game
0,"But then I was just waiting for my chances, and I think in the second set I took my chances"
1,In the third set I think I create chance for myself because I was playing really good and felt the ball really good
0,"Yeah, in the end I think just playing solid was the key for me today"
0,"KiKi told us that you two never played before, right"
0,Yeah
1,"So we can see KiKi deliver many variations in her techniques, like dropshot, and also kept you running from side to side"
0, Is this part of the reason that maybe you need some time to adapt to her style
0," Because you two never play before, how did you adjust your strategy or emotion to turn around in the second half"
0,"Yeah, first of all, of course we never played each other before, but she was in the same situation"
0, I was not really thinking about it
0, I knew that she was going to bring like variations with her game because she's playing lots of doubles and she's really a good doubles player as well
0, So I was really kind of expecting this
1,"But, you know, it was not about how good she can dropshot or something"
1, I don't think she did many in the first set
0, I was just giving her too much time to open the court
1,"Yeah, I think this was the big problem in the first set"
1," Then when I had some time in restroom to think about what happened in the first set, I was like, Come on; you need to step the court and just try to do something with the ball, otherwise she's going to kill you"
0,"Yeah, I was trying to put pressure with my shots, and I think it worked really good"
0,"This is your opening match of the tournament, but it's such a long and tough one; you need two hours"
0," How will this long, tough match influence you in your preparation for the future games"
0,"Well, I expect long matches here because everyone is playing so well"
0," It's kind of normal because everyone have a high rank, so everyone is in the same kind of condition"
0, It's quite normal that there will be long matches
0,"Well, I have my fitness coach here so I'm prepared for long tournament, for long matches"
0, I will try to do my best to recover well
0," I don't know yet when I'm playing, but not playing tomorrow, so I have couple of days off to recover and go for next match"
0,Looking forward for next challenge
0,I think you were the first player to arrive here for the tournament
0, How much do you think that extra preparation helped you
1,When I lost the first set I thought it was the worst thing to do
0,"  Yeah, well I thought that it was bad idea to come here earlier"
0,"Yeah, but then I started to think differently"
0, I started to say to myself what to do on court
0,"Yeah, it's a bit strange because the balls and the court are completely different from last years"
0, It's so different
0, I think everyone is in the same condition and everyone is trying to do their best
0,Everyone is on such a high level here; everyone is adapting really well
0," It's quite normal because here is top players, so we're used to adapt fast and quick"
0,"Last two questions: You mentioned that it is difficult to like find training bases in your country, in Ukraine, and also get out of the country to find good sponsors, or also sponsor your training and playing matches overseas"
0, Did you also come across such challenges or difficulties when you were young
0, How did you overcome the challenges
0, Who give you the biggest help
0, This is the first question
0,Okay
0, I answer first
0," Well, I got really lucky because I have great support from my family"
0," My brother, he used to play professional as well, and was coaching me when I was young, until 12 years old"
0," Then I moved to the other city, which called Kharkiv in Ukraine where I got sponsored"
0, I'm still the ambassador of the place where I used to practice for many years when I was young called Superior Golf Club
0,"There is also tennis court, so I was there most of the time"
0, I got really lucky that I had this opportunity
0," Yeah, then I moved and I was practicing in the academy"
0,So my career was all the time like step by step
0, I don't know
0, Everything just was going not quick
0," Was not rise so fast, but then everything was like quite solid in knew my"
0, I think it helped me a lot
0," It was sometimes of course tough moments in my career, but I always had this support with my family, with my team"
0,"Yeah, I think I can call myself really, really lucky"
0,Two questions: I know this year you've won in Rio and Beijing over No
0, 1 players
0, Does it give you any positive signal for your future competition with high-ranking players
0, Next question is: What's your goal for your next year's ranking
0,"Well, it was great experience for me to play in Olympics first of all, and then beating Serena as the player who is such experienced player and won so many things, I'm not sure I even dreamed to win so many titles as she has done"
1,"Yeah, beating Kerber as well"
0, She's really on top of her game for a moment
0, She had amazing year
0,"Of course it build me a lot of confidence and I was -- yeah, I'm just trying to take match by match"
0, It's always for me really -- I try to focus on each match
0," Of course there is some matches which means a lot for me, and I try to take positive things and I try of course always think what I can improve more"
0,Because I think in those matches which I won against them it was really -- I was playing really well and keeping my emotions on a high level
0," That's why I think this was the key in that game, in that moment"
1,You had a really good win over Vesnina a few months ago
0, Curious if you will do anything different before that match to maybe start maybe a little bit faster and be prepared for that next match
0,"Yeah, I will try to prepare well, to recover, first of all"
0, She's of course really confident I think at the moment after winning doubles in Singapore
0, It's a big thing for her and for Makarova as well
0,I think she would come really confident into the match
0, I will try just to stick to my game
0, I will sit down with my coach and speak about the match
0, Probably he will see what I've done good in New Haven where I played her
0,"Yeah, it's a new match, new challenge"
0, There will be new opportunities
0, I will try to create of course opportunities for myself
0," Yeah, I will do my best"
0,"Curious, after yesterday's match, what did you do to turn things around and have such a successful day today"
0,"Well, so the fun answer, which is not the official one, will be that I got inspired by your masks"
0,And so with painting I got zen
0, I figured my inner Feng Shui or whatever you call it
0, I started to realize that I have a lot of power inside
0, That I can do it today
0," This was the fun answer, not the more -- sorry, you're going to need to work a lot again"
0,"A little more serious answer is that I stepped on the court today thinking like, Okay, well, yesterday I just managed to win two games"
0, Let's try to win a little bit more today
0, Basically let's try to have fun
0,"I chose this sport, this job"
0, I'm working hard all year long to be on a big stage if I can and to win matches
0, I enjoy the game
1," I think I should be inside a little kid who just wants to play, which is so happy to be able to win a match, and not thinking about all the frustration parts of this career or of my game, which is working or not working, why my serve is not so consistent or whatever"
0,"I just said, Okay, Well, try to have fun"
0, That's it
0," This is probably your last match of the year, because I don't think I have any chance to be No"
0, 1 in our group anymore
0,You have a slight chance
1,"No, but even if Babos wins like love and 1 there is no way, because then she would be No"
0, 2 in the team
0,I think officially
0," I don't know if mathematically at the moment, but technically you're still in it right now"
0,"Yeah, but I will not be No"
0, 1 I think mathematic-wise
0," Unless there is an injury, which I don't wish for no one"
0, So that's it
0,"That's why I said, Okay, let's try to have fun"
0," I just let the two games go and told myself, Don't get frustrated"
0, It won't help
0, Just try to enjoy
0, Make smart decisions
0, Try what you can do best and just compete
0, Because I love to compete
0," Yeah, that's it"
1,We all know that you upload a blog after Stan Wawrinka won the US Open
1," You know, when you update an article about your finding inspiration from Stan Wawrinka"
0,I have a blog you said
0,"No, I mean you upload an article on Twitter"
0,"Oh, I was watching his match, yeah"
0,You wrote a long article about
0,"I was so, so tired, dead tired, but I just couldn't keep my eyes off the screen"
0,Yes
0, We all know that
0, So I'm very interested about whether you have good connections with him or did you have conversations about your inspirations from him or something like that
1,"It's kind of funny, but you probably don't know but my coach right now, Dimitri Zavialoff, is the former coach of Stan"
1, So he was the man that taught Stan to play his first backhands or first forehands
1,My coach is born in '76 so he was just 40 this year
1," Stan, he's from '85, so it's not a big age difference"
0," But still, can you imagine my coach at a young age teaching someone from nowhere and getting him to top 10"
1,The funny situation is that the best ranking my coach had with Stan was No
0," Then they stopped in 2010, I think"
0, Then I started again in 2013
0, My best ranking so far is No
0,So I would be -- it's already awesome that I could be No
0," 9, because I think it's a big thing for a coach just to pick one small kid from, I don't know, age of eight and bringing him top 10, No"
0," 9, and taking me, a woman which is 25, not that young anymore, and bringing her top 10 again"
0,"I mean, I don't think he has to prove anything else anymore"
1," With Stan, well, we don't talk that much because now you know how big Stan is"
0, He's very busy and I understand that
0,This year in Indian Wells he sat down with me for a coffee for an hour and we talked about many things
0," I asked him some of the questions that I -- for example, I was coming back from an injury, and many time I was like -- when at the press conferences they were asking me, Okay, what happened today"
0," I was like all the time for the last three months, Oh, well you know, my knee"
0, I'm coming back from an injury and everything
0,"One advice he told me is he said, Well, listen, don't use that as an excuse anymore"
0, It's all right
0, It's done
0, Don't stick with that
0, Just look forward
0, It's okay
0, You lost because you were not good enough
0, That's it
0," Don't bring up the thing of your knee, that you have been injured for the last three months"
0,"Even you, just look forward"
0, He gave me like one or two small advices because he has been through a knee injury as well
0," That's why -- I mean, it was only one hour, but it was way much than an hour for me"
0," But for sure, like I cannot say, Hey, please, please, please tell me something for sure"
0, It's also nice for me to find out myself some of the solutions for my own career
0,He inspires me a lot
1, For sure you have the talent of Roger and then you compare Stan
0, His talent is that he's a huge worker
0, This is a talent: he works
0, He just looks straight and works no matter what
0,This is a big thing as well
0, He's not looking back
1," Well, I try to get inspired, but not only of him, as well of Roger for sure"
0, Biggest inspiration ever
0," Really tough to have his talent, so"
1,And Martina as well; Belinda as well
0, I think I can get inspired of everyone
0, I also look at other players and I get inspiration all around me
0," So, yeah, this is how I try to build my own career"
0,It sounds like your new coach has inject some big boost into you
0, Is there a specific goal you want to reach next season
0, Second question: We notice that Chinese opera mask
0, Is that a gift to you
0," As you mention, this is probably your last match of the year"
0, How do you rate this tournament and also the city
0, Are you going to stay for several days to enjoy this more
0,"Okay, so the first question was -- because you had three questions"
0, The first one is about my coach
0, He's not new
0, I'm working with him for three and a half years
0,What was the push of the day
0, What helped me to win the match today
0,"What's my goal, okay, for next season"
0," Well, I don't work with specific goals"
0, No numbers
0, For sure my best ranking was No
0, 9 and I would love to be No
0, I know it's a lucky number in China
0," I was born 8 of June, so I'm lucky"
0,"No, just try to work hard again"
0, Try to enjoy as much as I enjoy every time I'm stepping on the court
0," It's important to love your job, because it's not a job anymore if you love it"
0, It's not hard to do it if you love it
0,"This is important, because I know it's going to keep me going for several years"
0," So really, no goals in particular since I came back in 2013"
0," I believe I can be limitless, so I don't put myself any limits"
0," I don't say, This will be the goal"
0," If I reach it, okay, fine"
0,"I'm more like if you reach something, awesome"
0, You can go for even more
0, That's my spirit
0, We're working like that with my coach
0,"And about the opera mask, yesterday when I finished the press conference we have something in the players' lounge where you can do the nails, which I haven't done"
1," You can paint a mask and write your name in Chinese calligraphy, which I would love to, but probably it would be too complicated to write because Bacsinszky is kind of difficult"
0,"So the woman which was doing that, with the help of this woman here, she organized me two masks for today"
0," I would have loved to paint them, but probably I would need like three hours for both of them"
0," It was already 6:30, yesterday"
0," It would be long, so that's why -- that's why she said she's going to bring it to me today"
0,Thank you very much
0, It's an awesome gift
0, I would love to hang that on my wall back home
0, I love to do that
0,"Then the last question about Zhuhai, it's my last match"
0, If it's my last match it's amazing because it's a win
0, It's awesome to finish the year with a win
0,"About spending more days in Zhuhai, it's -- I probably need to stay here"
0, Depends what's my ranking in the group
0," As long as I have to stay here, I will, for the tournament"
0,"Then if I can do some sightseeing, for sure I would love to"
0," My coach went already to Macao, but I didn't go"
0, I was too lazy
0, And I don't like to play
0," I know Asian people love the game, but I don't care that much"
0," I love to play myself tennis or other sports but not -- I don't know, not in casinos"
0, Not yet
0, Maybe it's coming later
0,"And about the tournament, it's great"
0, First time here for me
0, Organization is fine
0, People are really nice with me as well
0,"Yeah, I think the fans are awesome as well"
0, Today I felt the push also of some fans which were cheering for me
0, I feel really honored to have so many fans rooting for me
0,"Yeah, well, I'm really happy that I got to be here in Zhuhai this year, which I couldn't do last year"
0,It's his fault
0, He asked three questions
1,There was a medical timeout during the match
0, Did it impact you for the rest of the match
0, Did it impact your moving or anything else
0,What was the first thing
1,There was a medical timeout
0, Did it impact you for the rest of the match
0,"Well, it's end of the season, so I had some blisters on my feet"
0, Also pain here and there
0,"Well, it's normal"
0, Everyone has pain
0, Everyone goes on court and feels sometimes
0," Because I was probably so quick and you need to run really fast, so it's a lot of stress into the body"
0, It's quite normal
0,But just probably today was too much
1, Not enough to beat Petra
1,You were leading 4-1 in the first set; then she came back
0, What do you think was going wrong on your side
0,"Well, I started really well, and then in 4-1 I played some stupid -- made some stupid decisions"
0,She just took the opportunity
1," I gave her this opportunity, and because she is so experienced and so aggressive player, she took it straightaway"
0,"Yeah, so it's for me just another experience that I need to be more focused, more precise with my plan"
0, With top players you cannot do these mistakes
1," I missed my chance to win a set, and then you never know what could happen afterwards"
0,So
0,Yesterday after the semifinal you gave your towel to the someone the crowd
0, What did they exactly do so that you gave them your towel
0, Were you surprised you have so many fans and China
0,"Well, I gave the towel to the fan from actually my city"
0, He was from Odessa
0, He was supporting me all the match
0, They were screaming my name
0,"You know, it's always nice to have a lot of fans, because you lost the first set and they fired me up to push myself to the limits"
0,"Like I did, I came back stronger"
0," So it's amazing that the fans can do that, to push you to go for more"
0,That's why sometimes I give the towel or wristband or headband after my match
0," Just to give them something at least, part of me, because they gave me so much as well, so much support"
0, It's really amazing feeling
0, That's why I try to give it back
0, It's also very important
0,"Questions in English, please"
1,So this week you've had Stephanie Graf at your coin toss
1, Earlier in the week you had Judy Dalton from the Original 9
0, What was it like to have so many figures of the WTA's past still involved in tennis today
0, What did you think of that
0,"Yeah, it's so great that we have that opportunity to see them and to go back in history to see what they achieved in their career"
1,"Also, you know, like Billie Jean as well"
0," We have this opportunity to go for -- it's called Power Hour with her, and she explains all the thing what they done and how they did WTA"
0,So it's just amazing
0, I all the time go
0," Sometimes it's only for players who's coming up, but me, every year I go into this meeting"
0, I always enjoy
0," It's great that you have that opportunity to see those people, because it's always very interesting how they did it"
0,Tennis was completely different then it's now
0," You know, it's -- still it's just great experience to meet them"
0,My question is: What are you going to do after Zhuhai
0, Any plans
0,"Yeah, go to Maldives tomorrow morning"
0,You were here last year as well and your performance was pretty good
0, How do you comment your game today
0,"Well, was a tough match of course"
0," Barbora is a great player, a tricky player, a different player"
0, Of course I'm so happy to be coming here for the second time
0,"Yeah, today I lost, but tomorrow there is another match"
0, I will try my best tomorrow
0, Today I try my best
1," I had just 3-1 in the first, a lot of chance, but Barbora is a different player"
0, She always come to the net
0, She run a lot
0," She is solid, solid player"
0,Bad luck today
0, I will try my best tomorrow
1,You said you were feeling a little bit injured at the US Open
0, Curious how you're feeling physically now
0,Better
1," At the US Open I had problem on my foot, but now I'm much better"
0," I practice not so much in Italy, but now I'm okay"
0," You know, I didn't play Linz and Moscow"
0," I had two weeks off for recover, for a little bit of rest, and practice"
0,But the important thing is that I'm okay right now
1,You've had some good success against Petra in the past
0, What kind of strategy will you bring into the next match
0, How will you prepare
0,All the same
0, Not different kind of tennis
1, Just my game: play aggressive
1, Petra is unbelievable player; left-handed
1, Have to be aggressive
0, A lot of slice of course
1,"Well, I have to play good game tomorrow to win against Petra, yes"
0,This is your second time here in Zhuhai
0," How do you comment on the organization of the event, and what do you like about the city"
0,"Yeah, this is my second time here"
0, Everything is perfect
0, Everything is nice
0," Hotel, organization, the court, the crowd"
0,"It's a big event here, and, well, really happy to be here for the second time"
1,During the US Open you were asked about whether you planned to play next season
0, You said that you would get back to us
0, Curious if you've come closer to making that decision one way or the other
0,"No, no"
0, I just want to finish this tournament and then I will decide
0, But I don't want to think about my future
0," Just play this tournament, stay focused I hope three or four more days, and then we will see"
0,You had a really strong start to the match
0, Curious what the key was and what made the difference in the end
0,"Yeah, I think it was really good match"
1," I think the first set I played really good, aggressive, and then I think I got broken"
0, A little bit unlucky in the end of second
1," I think she also started to play better, more aggressive"
1,"Then third set, yeah, my body felt a little bit tired, but I gave everything today"
0, She was just the better one in the end
0,It's been such a strong year for you
0," Curious what it means to be in Zhuhai, to have been able to qualify for a year-end event, and what that does for your confidence and motivation heading into next season"
0,I think a lot
0, I really see it is a bonus on a great year
0, I think last year I ended the year outside top 100
0, I was 104 starting the year and now I'm 22
0, I am really happy with the year I had
0," My second career title, my semifinal in Paris"
0,So I have some great memories about last year
0," I'm really happy to have, yeah, this tournament as a bonus at the end of the season"
1,"Being that it's a round robin format, the fact you won a set gives you a perhaps a chance to go into the semifinal"
1, What will you take into your next match against Vesnina
1,"Well, it was also funny that I never played against Svitolina or Vesnina, so both first time"
0, It was really nice
0," I think the only two players here that I never played, so that was really, really nice for me"
0,"Yeah, I think in this format it's just like another match"
0," Maybe it's going to be my last match of the year, maybe not"
0," I am just going to put all my energy in there and give everything, and then we'll see what happens after the matches"
0,You practice with Zhang Shuai way before the match
0, Are you good friends
0,"Well, if she ask me to warm up again, of course"
0, I think it was fun
0, The warmup was nice
0, I watch her match and she played unbelievable match
0,"Yeah, I'm happy for her"
0,Two keys here for today
1," I think that you did great serving, and for the whole year you had a little over 30 aces; for this match you got seven"
1, You did a lot of volleys when you were trying to get back into the game
0, Can you comment on those two keys
1,"Yes, I always think that serving is something that I need to improve"
0, I did spend a lot of time practicing
1," Today I don't think my serving was particularly good, although more aces than the previous match"
0, But for my standard I don't think I did better than the last one
1,"Although I didn't have as many aces in my last match, my first serve was better and I won more points on my first serve"
0, Today I missed quite a few first serves
1, For my second serves because my opponent played very aggressively
1,It would be better if my first serve was better so that I can win my games more easily
1," Of course more volleys, that is also something my coach, Liu Shuo, always told me to do"
0,"I'm pretty happy that I can beat a powerful opponent, because this was never my thing"
0, Since the day I started my career it was not my style
0, I was a relatively weaker kid; now I am still not very strong
1, That's why I am so happy that I can beat someone that powerful and aggressive
0,After today's match you will be qualified for the semifinals
0," Your ranking at the moment, your year-end ranking might be breaking a record soon"
0," At the beginning of the year you were still outside the top 100, and now at the end of the year you are in the top 30"
0," Looking back at this year, do you think the result itself impresses you more or what you have done impresses you more"
0,I feel the lower you were the more space you will have for improvement
0, If I were out of top 1000 I would be enjoying even more
0," So my ranking was about 200 the end of last year, exactly 200 at this moment last year"
0," I am 20 something today, so one zero gone"
0,What happened during the past 52 weeks I was very amazed at and I felt like this is a fairy tale
0, It seems that everything nice took place in the past year
0, I am so happy for myself
0," I was in the top 30, down to 200, then back to the top 30"
0, I certainly hope this is not the end for me
0, I hope that I can break more records
0,"First of all, congratulations on the semifinal"
0," Although you won the match, during the match there were issues with the audience and volunteers"
0, Did that affect your performance
0, How did you deal with such disturbance
0,I didn't feel there was much -- my slow start wasn't because of the audience
0," My opponent was playing very well, and she is a very different opponent with fast shots"
0, I think this is very natural
0,"I was glad that after the beginning I was able to win the match and also that even though the beginning wasn't that great, I could still come back"
0," For me it was a very big improvement, especially when my opponent was playing so well"
1,"I got broken, and if it was me before I wouldn't have been able to come back"
0,"Of course when we are speaking of the audience, I do feel some of them are a bit unbelievable"
0," They were moving all the time, even though they were told to sit down"
0, Why did you keep moving
0,Also many volunteers kept moving as well and crouching down
1," To be honest, Babos had a lot of serves over 180 kilometers an hour"
0, I don't think the radar gun was correct because I don't think my speed was only 140
0,So her speed was definitely more than 180
0, Some of them even over 190 or even 200
1, So I was here preparing to return this serve that is almost 200 kilometers an hour and you were moving there
1,How was I supposed to return that kind of serve
0," Similarly, this didn't only happen to me, but I can speak the language that everybody understands here"
0,But my opponent also believes there were things against the rules or that were impolite
0, I do feel that this needs to be improved
1, I was squatting there ready to return the serve for like seven or eight seconds
1, Because of the moving audience my opponent could not make the serve
0," She had to wait, so I had to wait more, for like 20 seconds, and my legs were sore"
1,Then all the sudden she served
0, Don't you think that's a huge impact
0, I am happy that people are here cheering me on
0, I believe you wanted me to win
0, Am I right
0,"If you do want me to win, please be quiet and sit down"
0, At least do sit down when you should be sitting down
0, Why can you not wait for the end of those two games
0, Why did you have to stand up immediately
0, That's something I couldn't understand
1,Over the past few years you're trying to become a more aggressive player
1, Kvitova is one of the top aggressive players in the world
0, What difference do you see between you and what do you think of your performance today
0, Did you do your best
1,"Yes, we know that Kvitova is one of the top aggressive players"
0, She's the top one because she can finish the game before you are even picking up
0,"Although you have more games to go before the end of this year, this is pretty much the end of the season"
0, We know that your coach mentioned that for the next season there will be no pressure on you
0, What is your expectation for the next season
0,I will just keep enjoying playing tennis
0,"This is the end of the season, and you mentioned during the off-season you will be practicing more"
0," I would like to know, where you going to make the most improvement"
0,All of them
0,"Questions in English, please"
0,"I'm just curious, after the year you've had, how do you sum up 2016"
0, What did you make of your week in Zhuhai after so many great wins and making the semifinal
0,I'm pretty happy about myself for the year
0,I just have one more announcement to make
0, I just got an SMS text message from a friend yesterday and got me very upset and guilty actually
0," I won't mention the name and the content; however, I would like to say that we are having this wonderful event in such a beautiful city in Zhuhai"
0,I don't want to ruin the event because of me or because of what I said about the moving or talking audience during the game
0," After the game during the press conference, I have never actually encountered so many questions on just one single issue"
0," I know there was a huge media coverage after the press conference as well, so I feel very guilty and upset"
0,"Also, I don't believe the staff member of the event should be the ones to be blamed"
0, They're all innocent and they have done a lot
0, They're taking responsibilities that they should not take
0,"I believe that both for myself and for my dear media friends, can we please stay positive for the future events and help the events, because it's such a rare opportunity to have this event in China"
0, We know how much our sponsor and the Association of Tennis in China spent for the establishment and construction of this tennis center
0, I really don't want the event to be ruined because of me or you or anyone here
0,All we want for the Chinese tennis industry to become better
0, That's why I would like to say that I like all the staff members here
0, They have done a great job
0, I saw their efforts
0," I saw the court here, the surroundings here"
0," Everything here is amazing, so let's stay positive"
0,What happened during the matches here also happened in other countries as well
0, I always do the same
0, I'm not just doing it here
0, Any it also never happened that so many questions were asked for just one single issue during the press conference after any given match
0,So we are all in this tennis world
0, I am the player and you're journalists
0," Again, let's try our best to make China's tennis a better world"
0, Let's all work towards that goal
0,I have always been me
0, I don't have that temper because of my loss
0, Just because what I said or just because you asked
0, I don't want this to be the reason why anyone else got blamed
0, Let's respect each other
0," We know that, again, many staff members, because of what was said and what we did, they were taking responsibilities that they should not take"
0,"Again, we're in such a beautiful city"
0, Let's stay positive and respect each other
0, Thank you
0,"Congratulations, Johanna"
0,Thank you
0,"Coming from Singapore, I'm wondering, what is your mindset approaching this event"
0," Does it feel like, Okay, Zhuhai is great, but I'm going to think about next year"
0,"Well, right now I'm really happy to be here"
0," Coming from Singapore, obviously I was -- I felt really lucky and excited to be able to play and finish off the season playing"
0,"So, yeah, no, I'm very happy to be here"
0, Obviously Singapore is a pinnacle for our tour
0," In terms of wanting to be involved if such events, I definitely would love the opportunity next year"
0," If I'm involved here again, I still feel pretty good about that"
0,Just talk a little bit about your semifinal
1, You're going to face Elina in the semifinal tomorrow
0,"Well, I don't believe I've played her before, although I found out sometimes before I've played a player and I can't remember"
0, As far as I know I don't think I've played her
0,She I think made semis here last year and definitely enjoys playing here
0, She's a great player
0, She's had a great year
0, Actually a great number of years
0,She's been consistently in the kind of top 30 for a while now
0, It'll be a tough one
0, Looking forward to the challenge
1,"Some people made a comparison between and you Elina, because in the year of 2010 she was also an alternate to the WTA Tour Championship and did not receive a chance to play, and the next year she won a Grand Slam title"
1, [Sic] They said Joanna probably going to win a major title this year
0, What do you think of that
0,"Well, if they have a crystal ball and saw that, that's brilliant"
0," Unfortunately, I don't think such a crystal ball exists"
0, For now I really am just enjoying playing
0, I'm enjoying my journey
0, Next year will bring its own challenges
0, I'm looking forward to them
0,"In terms of how results will go, that remains to be seen"
1,Navarro said at the moment she really felt exhausted because she was away from home for too long; she needs to go home and get the energy back
0, Do you feel tired right now physically or mentally
0,I think if you ask every player right now they are definitely under a considerable amount of fatigue
0, It's the end of our season and our season is a long one
0,So I think everyone is in the same boat
0," I still feel very motivated to play, so I think that is the main thing"
0,Otherwise the rest of it is management
0, Just managing your energy levels and managing your body
0,"I notice between 2012 and 2014 your year-end ranking is always between 101 and 50; last year into top 50, and now you secure top 10"
0, You mention hard working the other day
0, I believe lots of girls work very hard
0, What's the magic button
0, What happened in the past two years
0,"There is no magic button, and I sound like a broken record with this"
0, I promise you there is none
0,"I think, like I said numerous times, for me personally, on my journey, it was about just gaining experience and going through certain situations to keep developing myself as a player and also as is person off court"
0,"So I felt like I needed to mature in many different areas to be able to deal with the pressures that come with performing week in, week out on the tour"
0,"Obviously that doesn't guarantee that you will always perform well, but definitely gives you the best chance to do so"
0,Quick question about the match
0, Pretty decisive in your favor
0," How do you feel you're playing right now, and what do you feel like you did to get the match won so decisively"
0,I think I just did a really good job playing quite consistently at a high level throughout the match
0, I don't think I gave her much breathing room
0, That always works in a players' favor
0, And both for me and against me when players do it against me
0,So I was quite happy with that
0, I thought I played quite freely
0, I really enjoyed being out there
0, I really enjoyed just playing tennis
0,So I think that really came through today
1,Earlier this year you play Shenzhen Open and a lost to a Chinese player
0, A volunteer saw you sitting on the ground after the match and took a picture of you
0, Looks like you were pretty upset
0," Now when you look back, how do you summarize your performance of the season 2016"
0,"Sorry, I didn't quite understand"
0,Is it true
0, A volunteer saw you after the match sitting on the ground
0, Seemed like you were crying at that time; is it true
0,I don't know
0, That was at the beginning of the year
0," In Shenzhen, right"
0,Yeah
0,"Yeah, I had a really tough first round"
0, Possibly
0,  I don't know
0, Possibly
0,What's the question
0,How do you summarize your performance of this season
0,What does your question have to do with the first part
0,"Looking back, what you have been throughout those years, did you expect that"
0," I mean, in January in Shenzhen did you expect that you are now a top player now"
0,"Quite honestly, I've enjoyed every part of my year"
0, Expectation of being where I am
0," No, I was not -- I didn't have a goal of this"
0," I didn't say, This is where I want to be at the end of the year"
0,"But my goal was to keep getting better and keep improving and keep, yeah, keep going in a positive direction with every opportunity that I got"
0,I felt I was able to maximize my opportunities this year
0, And not necessarily win all of those matches; I lost plenty of matches this year
0, I am sure I cried plenty as well
0,We apply ourselves to our sport 100%
0, I feel very blessed and very fortunate to have had the year that I have had
0,"So, yeah, I think 2016 has been very kind to me"
0,"As the most-improved player of this season, if you have to name one specific thing you have improved the most, what would it be"
0,"Well, obviously it's a combination of things, but I guess my tolerance"
0, My tolerance to be able to both mentally and physically be able to recover on a consistent basis
0," Because I did play a lot of matches this year, a lot very full weeks"
0,"I think my ability to keep, yeah, recovering and keeping myself in a good state of mind"
1,Steffi Graf will be here tomorrow
0, She's the ambassador of this tournament and clearly one of the greatest tennis player in history
0," In your opinion, what kind of person and player to you"
0,Sorry
1,"In your opinion, how do you think about Steffi Graf achievement, and not just in tennis, and, you know, generally"
0,"Well, she's quite incredible"
0, I think her achievements speak for themselves
0, I don't think I'm in any position to pass judgment on them
0," Yeah, she's one of the greatest players of all-time in our sport"
0,"For me growing up, I definitely looked up to her in terms of her image and just the class act that she was both on and off court"
0,"So, if I get the chance to meet her, I would be very, very excited"
0,Just a few
0, Late start this week
0, Curious how the match went and what you think was the key to your win today
0,"Yeah, it was good to start only today, to have some single practice and get used to the condition"
0,"But it was also hard, because some people are already out, some are already qualifying, and you're only starting"
0,"No, I think it was really good and solid match from me"
0, The last singles match was not very good
0, It was kind of complicated
0, So I'm happy the way I played today and the way I came back in the first set
1," I was on 4-1, double break"
0,So it was good to win the first one
1," After I got broken on the first game after two game point for me, but I came back strong and I was really calm all the way"
0,So you were pretty focused on doubles last week
0, How do you feel the made the shift from doubles to singles
0,Obviously good
0,"  Yeah, but it's never easy"
1," We have to focus only on doubles in Singapore, and most of the time with Kristina we never practice doubles"
0, We always practice our singles
0, So it was kind of the first week we did some doubles drills
0,"It was really intense match over there in Singapore, really tough"
0, We did semis
0," It was good, but we don't know, it was kind of so-so"
0, But we gave everything
0," The other one was better, so after I just tried to focus on my single preparation"
0,"Here I have three days, so it was kind of the supervisor in the tournament to let me play today"
1,You have Konta next
0, You've played twice this year
0, How will you prepare for your next match
0,It will be really tough match
0, Last time I played against her it was straight win and not a lot of games
0,So I think she had a great year
1, She has a lot of confidence behind her and she's playing some aggressive game
0,So I will try to play my best
0," If I can get some inspiration about today, it may help me tomorrow"
0,Strong start today
0," Curious, what do you think the key was in the end and what made the difference for you"
0,"Yeah, I definitely did start off really well"
0," I was really, I felt, dictating a lot on my terms"
0,I think she did a really great job of putting herself back into the match
0, She also raised her level; I definitely dropped mine a bit
0,I think the momentum just shifted and then I couldn't quite recover it
0, She kept running away with it really
0, Really wasn't in it much at the end
0, It was interesting
0,"But, yeah, no, I think she played a more consistently high-level match than I did"
0,Still a very high-quality match throughout
1," A lot of winners, especially in the third set"
0, Does that provide any kind of solace in the aftermath of a loss for you
0,"Quite honestly, I am happy with how I did today"
0, I think I did the best that I could with the cards that I had with everything
0, I really left it all out there
0, There wasn't any more I could have given
0,Obviously would've been nice to have a couple things go my way a bit more
0," Quite honestly, she did a great job of really pulling the match towards her end"
0,"Yeah, I couldn't have done much more today"
0,Talking about your year
0,Are we just having a conversation
0,We've been talking about your year for the last couple weeks
0, You could do a lot of micro-assessing of your season
0," At what point, if at all, will you look at the whole picture and take away some major themes or things you want to improve on, or have the small steps throughout your season made that easier going into the off-season"
0,"I guess because we are continuously looking to get better, so after each match we already look to be better the next day"
0," So I guess it's not so much of a, Let's look at everything we did and let's see what we can improve on"
0, It's a continuous process
0,We will enjoy the year we had together as a team
0, I think everyone is very pleased with the progress we've made
0,"Then equally, I think all of us are really excited to just keep improving come the pre-season and next year"
0,"Lastly, what do you take away from this week in Zhuhai, and how soon do you head to Rome for vacation"
0,"Quite honestly, I feel very, very lucky and blessed that I got to finish my year here"
0, I'm really happy I got to finish my year playing and finish playing I think three great matches
0,It's been a great event here
0, If I'm not in Singapore next year then I would love to be here
0," So, yeah, I feel very happy to have come here this year"
0, I will be home for a week first and head to Rome for three days
0,Obviously you already got the award of most developed player this year
0," I want to know whether you have time to take part in the IPTL for the vacation, to play more tennis"
0,No
0, I'm currently not scheduled to be playing any exhibitions or anything along those lines
0," I'm going to take full advantage of having some time off, and then training"
0,What do you think happened today in the match
0,"Yeah, I think I got off to a really good start and was playing well"
0," Probably from 4-1 I got a little bit tight and my balls started dropping a little bit short, and then that gave her an opportunity to step into the court and get more on top of the points and kind of gain control back"
0,I think that's really just what shifted it
0,"Then, you know, second set, again, good first game"
1, Unfortunately lost serve
1, She always plays very aggressive and really goes for it
0, If you're not able combat that then it's going to make things very difficult
0,But overall I don't feel like I played too bad
0, I was a little bit unlucky to lose serve in that second set
0, That's just the way it goes sometimes
0,Did you say tight or tired at 4-1
0,Tight
1,With Dave you didn't usually do a lot of on-court coaching with him
1, I saw Josh came down during the match
0,Uh-huh
0,"Is that part of the new arrangement and new partnership, that he wants to be more involved in the matches"
0, What was the reasoning behind that
0,"Yeah, we spoke about it the other day and, I don't know, we thought we would kind of use this week to try a few things out"
1, We had only been at two tournaments together previously and one was the US Open where you're not allowed to do it anyway
0,"Yeah, I don't know"
0, I don't know whether it's something we'll continue all the time or not
0," We kind of thought, You know what"
0, This week we have nothing to lose
0," Let's try it, see what happens, see if we like it, and go from there"
0,"Yeah, I don't feel like it hurt me by any means"
0, I don't know if on-court coaching in general often changes the result of what's going on
0," It certainly wasn't a bad thing, so I guess we'll discuss it more over the pre-season and see what we want to do next year"
0,Did you used to not like it
0, What was the reasoning for not wanting to do it that often before
0,Initially I was really against the whole idea
0, I didn't like it at all so I was never going to use it
1,"Then I feel like with Dave, you know, he was really strong about the player having to work it out themselves and that's how you're going to become a better player"
1,"I think because you can't use it in Grand Slams that was a big thing, not to be reliant on having your coach come down and tell you what to do"
0,I can see both sides
0, For some players it really works and maybe for some others it doesn't
0, I think it's finding what kind of works for you
1,"And moving forward, how do you and Josh leave this week"
0, Do you feel good about the partnership
0," How do you feel about your game and how you're playing, at least in the practice court and moving on into the off-season"
0,"Yeah, I guess this week it's obviously been disappointing to walk away without a win, so results-wise, that's, yeah, not great"
0,But I feel like the way I've been playing this week in these matches have been better than the matches I've played in China and Hong Kong through the Asian swing
0, So I guess that's a positive
0,I think you kind of have to break things down
0," If you just looked at it as a whole, Oh, it's another loss, another loss, you're going to get pretty disappointed and it would be very demoralizing"
0,"I think if we can kind of break it down and be like, Okay, this worked well; this was a better change; this didn't work well; this is what we got to do"
0,"I feel like we're pretty clear on what I've got to do, and now it's a matter of just getting out on the practice court and just getting better at it again"
0, So there is no secret
0, You just got to get better and win
0,"You're friend with Zhang Shuai, and she was affected by the crowd on court"
0," What is your approach when you have to face such noise or just walk around, the crowd's behavior"
0,"I didn't understand the start, sorry"
0,My question is
0," Zhang Shuai is your friend and she was kind of affected by the crowd's behavior, somebody walking around or just making some noises"
0,Okay
0,Ask them not to do it
0, I think her emotion is affected by that
0, I just ask what it is your approach when you have to face that kind of crowd behavior
0,"Look, I'm not -- when there is talking or people moving around it doesn't really bother me that much"
0, I feel like I'm focused on what's going on on the court
0,I know some people get really distracted by a noise or somebody moving; others it doesn't matter
0, I think obviously we have the way tennis is being played for a very long time
0,"But, yeah, I don't know"
0," Doesn't really -- I mean, nothing out on the court tonight bothered me, so that's just for me that's okay"
1,Strong start today; a little bit tenser the second set
0, How did you work it through and get it done so quickly in the end
1,"Yeah, the second set was a little bit tight"
1," It was really important to serve well in that game, 4-3"
1, I was facing two break points and it was really the key point
0,"And I think that from the time that I started to play more aggressive than I did before, the beginning of the second set, so it helped me actually, to face the two break points to get back on the track and play little bit better and to return better as well"
0,"But, I mean, overall it was a good match"
1, I think it was -- the serve was really good today; helped me a lot as well
0, I'm happy that I'm in the semifinal for sure
1,You played so well in the first set
0," Curious, when you're in one of those zones, how conscious are you of it as it's happening"
0, Is it something you try not to think about during the match
0,I'm not really thinking about that
0," I mean, I'm there and just focusing on the next point"
0," I think in the tennis it's very tricky when you sometimes looking back, which is not great"
0,"Even you win the point or you lose the point, but you still have to be in the time right now and not really thinking about the future as well"
0,"I mean, if I am playing well I'm not saying to myself, Okay, I'm in the zone"
0, It's very good
0, If I say that probably I would lose my concentration
0,"It's a little bit tricky, I have to say"
0, I just need to still be continuing the work I did
1,"Of course sometimes in the match you have the time when you're not feeling great, when you're a little bit down, low with the energy - or on the other hand, when you're playing really great and have winner by winner - and you still have to be kind of still going and try to not really thinking about what happened"
0,"It's going to be a marathon from here on out: your match today, semi tomorrow, and the final on Sunday"
0, How fresh do you feel now and how ready do you feel having the three matches over the next couple days
0,I think that we are used to from the tournaments
0," I mean, nothing really like new"
0," I had a day off yesterday, which I think helped me, my body as well, to recover a little bit"
0,"Yeah, I mean, semifinal and final is always kind of challenging as well"
0, You just going to put everything what you have in that moment
0,I just don't really think that it's like kind of problems
0," Of course not everyone has the same conditions, but, I mean, it's okay"
0,"Everybody has to handle it somehow, and I going to do the same"
0,China is lucky place for you
0, This is your first time in Zhuhai
0, How do you feel atmosphere is out there
0, How do you rate this tournament and the city
0,I'm surprised actually
0, It's very nice city
0, It's great even as well
0," I mean, I really like it"
0,"I didn't expect that many people today during the day, but it's came many of them and it was great atmosphere out there"
0,So it was really nice to play in front of them
0,One question: who do you think would be your strongest opponent for the rest of the week
0,Tricky question
0, I don't know who's going to advance into the semifinal so far
0, I have no idea
0," I think all four who can to advance to the semifinal will be tough anyway, because they play great in the group and win the two matches"
0,So I don't think it's any like have a good choice to play someone semifinal
0, I'm not really see anyone
0, All of them
1,"It was definitely not an ideal situation to be in I think for any player, including Kuznetsova"
0, I think she did an incredible job
0," I think to qualify the way she did going into Moscow knowing that if she won what it would mean, honestly, that was very impressive from her"
0,"From my side, I really just tried to make the most out of the week"
0," Enjoy the experience, see what it's like"
0, We do get treated very well there
0, We stay at a very nice hotel and the food is very good
0, Honestly just tried to make the most of it
0,I arrived here on Sunday morning
0," Yeah, Sunday early afternoon"
0,"A lot of people were saying you looked stunning and gorgeous last night, and before in Singapore"
0," Do you follow fashion, and how do you define beauty"
0, Sorry
0, Thank you
0," I was not expecting that question, so that's why I'm laughing"
0,"Well, I'm very flattered"
0, Thank you very much
0, I do try
0," I try my best to always I guess represent the tournaments well and just make an effort in general, because the tournaments put big efforts in putting those functions on for us"
0,I think it's important that we try just as hard
0, I do enjoy fashion
0," I do get some help though, so it's not all me"
0," Yeah, thank you for noticing"
0,This must be an expected question for you
0," Because you are voted as the most improved player of the WTA this year, can you share with us what's the biggest improvement that you have made to your techniques or mentality, something else"
0, Can you share with us your secret of such amazing season
0,"Well, unfortunately there is no secrets or magic potion or anything like that"
0, I think on my personal journey it was about really accumulating a lot of experiences and to really go through certain situations which improved me as a competitor and also as a person off court
0,I think going through some things really put me in a position to be prepared to consistently compete the way I have this year
0," I think that's probably been the biggest change, just the consistency I've been able to play at, the level that I'm playing"
0,But I promise you it's every day hard work
0, It's every day really making sure -- if it's easy or hard -- really making sure that you stick with the good habits and stick with the good things that you know are bringing you good things basically
0,What do you make of the format
1," It's not a traditional round robin, but you're guaranteed two matches"
0, What's your approach heading into the week
0,I'm really excited actually
0, Really happy to be here
0, Really excited that I get to finish my year here
0, I think so far I've just really enjoyed everything that I've got to experience so far with the hotel and also the venue here
0,"The format, I'm looking forward to it"
1, It will be the first time I've ever played in kind of a round robin situation
0," Well, since I was very young"
1, I remember when I was very little we played round robins
0,"So, yeah, guaranteed two matches is also great"
0, It's a great way to finish the year
0," Yeah, just hoping to -- looking forward to really giving it my all and see where that takes me during the week"
0,You're doing great this year in China: quarterfinal in Wuhan and final in Beijing; into top 10 for the first time
0, Does that give you extra confidence you can play well in China again this week
0," Also, you're the only top-10 player this week"
0, Do you think the tournament is for you to lose
0,I guess China has been good to me recently
0, I definitely do enjoy playing here
0," I think every tournament that I've played so far in China, the organization has tried incredibly hard to put on great events, and I do think they succeed in doing so"
0,I do enjoy coming here to play
1," I may be in the current rankings the only top 10 player here, but there are Grand Slam champions in this tournament"
0, There are girls from the tournament who were top 10 only two weeks ago
0,"And even the girls who aren't, I promise you every girl here plays a very high level of tennis"
1," Some of the girls have also been reaching quarterfinals, semifinals of Grand Slams this year"
0,It's anyone's tournament
0, I'm just here like everybody else and I am going to give my best and see where that takes me this week
0,How are you feeling physically at this point
0, I know you were dealing with a little bit of an injury two weeks ago
0, How much training did you do in Singapore and how are feeling now
0,I'm feeling really good
0," I think I made the decision when I did at the right time -- I mean, I always look to put my health and body first"
0, Without it I wouldn't be able to play
0,"So I made the decision at the right time to pull back and rested, and honestly everything cleared up in three, four days"
0, Since then I have been building up
0,"I have a four-week practice in Singapore, and really looking forward to play here"
0, Not going to lie: I'm also looking forward to going home and resting after the season is over
0,I feel motivated and really lucky that I still can play one more event this year
0,"I know that you are very busy, but when you do have time, what is your hobby"
0, What do you like to do
0, Australian always likes surfing or things
0, Do you also like to do some surfing or dangerous sports besides tennis
0,"I can't surf, so I definitely do surfing"
0," Actually, in general I'm not very good or coordinated at any other sports in general, so tennis is practically my only craziest thing that I do probably"
0,"In term of off-court hobbies, I love live music"
0, When I'm home I try to go to concerts
0, Otherwise I'm quite a homebody
0, I enjoy being home
0, I enjoy the comforts that that brings
0, I enjoy being with my family
0,"Traveling as much as I do, and all of us do, you don't really get a chance to not live out of a suitcase that often"
0, So I think just very normal and simple things I take a lot of joy from
0, One question for you
0, So your performance for the second half of this year was less than satisfactory and there were concerns about your future trend
0, Can you talk about this
0,"Yeah, it's been a disappointing second half of the year for me, no doubt"
0,"But, yeah, for whatever reason, it's been -- my results have not been very good"
0, I've changed coaches
0, I've been looking for a new coach
0," I think a lot of these changes that I've been trying to make and then find replacements, then it makes things very hard when you're away at tournaments not to have consistency"
0,So I think this is probably a big reason maybe why
0, Obviously I need to pick up my form and start to win some more matches
0,"Yesterday Zhang Shuai joked in the ceremony, draw ceremony, that the first player I pick is Sam"
0, How can you explain that
0, I think Chinese fans appreciate your friendship to her
1, You're Grand Slam champion
0,Yep
0,Could you remember the first time you meet with her
0, Can you tell us how your friendship develop in years
0,"Yeah, we met many years ago, I think maybe 2009 or 2010, something like this"
0,I remember we practiced together at a tournament in Charleston
0, She had a little bit of an Australian connection with a past coach
0, Her coach was coached by an Australian man
0,"Yeah, we just met and always got along really well"
0, I think they appreciated the way that I played and liked my style
0, Over the years we just practice a lot together
0, We go out for dinner sometimes together
0,"Yeah, we're good friends"
0," Makes it fun to see people like her at the tournaments every week, and now especially she's doing very well"
0, So it's nice to see her really come back from I guess a disappointment at this time last year to now find herself back in the top 30
0,"I think she's probably at her career-high, so very exciting for her"
0,"However, in the draw ceremony she put you in the same group with the top seed"
0, Could you please talk about your draw
1,"Yeah, obviously playing with Konta and Garcia in my group it's not going to be easy to get through"
0, I think my group is going to be difficult
0,"I mean, there are only three people"
0, You're going to have to win I think both matches to guarantee yourself to qualify obviously
0,"Jo, I guess she was in Singapore last week as a reserve, so she's been constantly playing and had a great year"
0," Going to be a difficult first match, but I'm ready to go"
0, It's a good test to test yourself against I guess the highest-ranked player here
0,"Even though you said second half of year is disappointing, you're guaranteed the highest year-end ranking in the past three years"
0,Uh-huh
0,You're 32; is that something you're proud of
0,"Yeah, I was actually just trying to remember what my year-end rankings were the last few years"
0," If this is my best one since then, that's obviously a positive"
0,"I know that I still have some improvement that I can make with my game, and every day that I go out to practice I'm trying to do just that"
0,"Yeah, even though it's been a little bit disappointing, it's still a good position to be in"
0, Hopefully I can really build on all this for next year
0," No matter what happens here this week, I just want to try and play well"
0,"Hopefully that results in some wins of matches, but really just try and get myself ready for next year and find that good level of tennis again"
0,"And even looking ahead to next season, knowing you made your first Grand Slam semifinal in a couple of years, how much confidence does that give you going into 2017 knowing you made a Grand Slam semifinal and can compete at the highest level of the game"
0,"Yeah, look, it's definitely motivating to know that this year I did make a semi in a slam"
0," Obviously I feel like if I can keep trying to improve, yeah, and find that form again, then there is no reason why I can't do that again"
0, It is good
0,"Like I said before, since then it hasn't been fantastic, my results"
0, I feel like I'm kind of getting myself back on track and ready to go again for 2017
0,"So I think it's important to find a good level of consistency so that week in, week out, you're right there"
0, Obviously some weeks you're going to have a really great one and maybe occasionally you'll have a poor one
0,"If you can find a good middle ground, there is always a chance to really step up"
0, Confidence plays a big role I think in tennis
0, You can have a not-so-good time and have a good week or two and find yourself playing very well and full of confidence
0,"Like I said, that really helps"
0,Curious what you make of this format
1," It's not a traditional round robin, but you're still guaranteed two matches"
0, Are you just looking forward to getting those two matches in
0, How do you strategize going into this tournament
0,Probably not a whole lot of strategy
0, You have to win otherwise you're not going to go anywhere
0,"Look, it is obviously different having such small groups, but it's not bad"
0, You know that you're coming here and you get at least two
0," Maybe if you win one it's depending how things fall, you still might make it through to the semis"
0,"So, I think it keeps it very exciting"
0, As the days go on you start to see who has a very good chance and who doesn't
0, Every match counts for something
0, No matter what
0, Maybe you can't get to the semis
0, It still means something to play that match and try and win it
0,I think that keeps the idea of playing well and competing hard -- everyone is going to do that every single match
0, I think that makes it exciting for the fans
0,"First of all, congratulations on your second win"
0, Two questions for you
0, This is your second time in Zhuhai
0," How do you comment on the facility here, the schedule of the event, and the city itself"
0, And question No
0," 2, you will be in the semifinal now"
0, Who is your favorite opponent and least favorite opponent
0,"Well, yeah, it was second time for me here"
0," I didn't see much of Zhuhai, but I heard good things about it"
0, Looks like a small New York and it's building a lot
0," Since last year as well a lot of work done, a lot of lights everywhere"
0,"You know, like on the building"
0, We're not used to see in Ukraine because we don't have that much probably money to take for electricity
0," So, yeah"
0,"Yes, I don't have any favorite opponent"
0," Yeah, they are playing well"
0, Everyone is playing well here
0, It's I think a little bit strange to say that I have someone favorite to play
0,"Yeah, I'm looking forward to the semifinal"
0," Going to be my second semifinal, so hopefully this time I will go further than last year"
0,"Yeah, we will look forward to Saturday"
0," Yeah, it's going to be very interesting match I think for sure"
0, Doesn't matter who I'm going to play
0,Questions in English
1,A lot of tough games in the first set
1, I think you saved six breakpoints in the first
1, How did you turn that around and stay up through the two sets and get it done so quickly in the end
1,"Yeah, I was trying to be really focused on my serve, because she is quite aggressive from both sides, from forehand and backhand"
0,So I was trying to mix it up a lot and just being in the moment
0, I think I was playing really well on the break points down
0," Yeah, it was just -- it was a good game for me today, very solid"
0," In important moments I was very solid, and I think that's why the score was my way"
1,I broke in the first set really playing aggressive
0," Yeah, it was solid game today"
1,Even though it was a round robin it was a pretty straightforward scenario
0, You win and make the semifinal
0," Did that help today, knowing you didn't have to deal with any math or complicated scenarios like that"
0,"Well, still was quite tough"
0, My first match was quite tough as well
0, Of course it's maybe quite obvious for media to say that it was obvious that I'm going to win
0,"Still for me, there was still a lot of work to do ahead in that moment"
0," So I was trying to just take match by match, set by set and just to give every thing"
0,Last tournament
0, I still try to don't think about it
0, I try to think that I still have couple tournaments ahead of me
0, When you think about your last tournament you start to be really down in energy
0, You start to think about Maldives or something
0,"Yeah, just I try to enjoy the moment"
1," I think it helped in the first match when I was down the first set, and then also today staying in the moment, it really help me a lot"
1,"Finally, Timea Bacsinszky brought in an opera mask"
0, Have you been to the station at the tournament where they're doing the nails and calligraphy and painting masks
0, Have you gotten to experience any of that yet
0,"No, I didn't do it yet because, yeah, I was too busy watching movies"
0, I am really interesting in that
0,"Yeah, I will do probably because it's quite traditional thing in China"
0, So I'm always trying to get something traditional from each country
0," Yeah, it's very interesting to see what people like and what is their traditions"
0," First of, all congratulations"
0, We learned that you only spent like 20 minutes practicing after you arrived in Zhuhai
0, How did you manage to have such a great performance after such a short time of practicing
0,I didn't practice only 20 minutes
0," I mean, I practice few times for sure, but not really hard, I have to say"
0," I mean, end of the season and I need to save some energy, which I think was great for tonight"
0,I'm pleased how I played today for sure
0, Was a great first match which I played on center court
1, Robby is always very challenging player
0, She is playing a little bit different than other players
0,"So for me, I was really focusing on every shots and didn't really know what it's coming, so I had to be focused"
1,So you've got Bara in your group and you said in the draw ceremony it was funny because you're both Fed Cup teammates
0, A lot of people asked about what it's like to play a friend
0, Perhaps a different thing to play a teammate
0, You're playing tennis and practicing so closely together
0, What do you make of that experience and what you'll bring into the next match
0,"Well, it's not the first time for me playing teammates or friend"
0, It's never really easy
0, We spend time here as well on the players' party and we already knew we were in the same group and we were still behaving normally as we did before
0,That's what I really like
0, Off the court it's everything possible
0, You step on the court and you're focusing on your game and not really the opponents
0, The emotions are a little bit different
0, Probably you are just keeping more inside of you
0,Of course when it's like big fight and really important points it's just going for it and just do what you can
0, Same with the other opponent
0,So that's what I going to try day after tomorrow
0," Yeah, and then next week we are in the team, and I hope that everything will be fine"
0," Even I loss or she loss or whatever happen, I hope that off the court we going to be good again"
0,"My answers are pretty long, so should shorten it"
0,You played so well the last few months
1," I know everyone is looking forward to the off-season, but is there a little bit of disappointment that after this week or Fed Cup you have to stop"
0,"A little bit, yes, I have to say"
0,"On the other hand, I think it's a good finish of the season - better than the first half, so I take it as well"
0," I always like to see the things more positive than the negative, so everything has both sides"
0,I'm glad that the game is there again
0, I do feel better on the court
0, I'm more confident
1, I'm going more aggressive than I did before in the first half of the season
0,"So, yeah, I mean, of course I wish that the season is still a little bit continue"
0, That's why I'm really glad I was able to qualify here and play
0," I mean, coming to Asia swing playing Tokyo, Wuhan, and Beijing was kind of the goal to qualify here"
0, Even I had a chance to qualify to Singapore which was very small
0,I'm really glad that I made it to play here and still have a chance to have more matches
1," Still we have Fed Cup next week, so that's good to play few matches here coming to Fed Cup"
0,Hopefully we going to finish the season on the highest stage
0,I remember in New York you were saying you didn't want to overexert yourself by going too much around the city
0, You'd stay between the hotel and the site
0," Are you doing the same here in Zhuhai, and were you doing that throughout the Asian swing"
0,"Well, when I played in New York, in the day off I didn't go on site and I was just staying in the hotel and have a little bit of walk or just a little bit of work in the fitness"
0,So I didn't really hit every day
0," I was saving energy, which I think is sometimes more important for me than just to play"
1, I'm kind of the player that doesn't have to play every day and still can't forget the forehand and backhand
0,In the Asia swing was a little bit different because I played all those matches and I didn't really have a day off between the matches and the tournament
0,Here I'm probably saving the energy for sure
0, I think it's end of the season and everybody is just a little tired
0, Everybody has small injuries and the body is not just working that well as in the beginning of the season
0,"So I'm just doing what I have to, spending the time by the physios and just resting"
0," But I hit few times for sure, otherwise I can't get the conditions here"
0," Yeah, I'm just doing it by the feel probably, how I feel"
0," If I need to practice, I go"
0," If I don't really, then I just stay"
0,"I think I'm good in that, if I can say"
0, I'm trying to improve it as well and feel my body more that I used to before
0,We notice the beautiful rings on both hands
0, Also we know when the ring appears in this finger always means something
0, Any special meaning for the rings
0,Nothing new
0, Sorry
0, It's just the ring
0, Nothing really surprise
0,"When you were growing up you were watching a lot of players break through at 18, 19, and 20"
1," Now this generation is watching players like Angelique and Li Na ans Schiavone all win slams at 28, 29, 30"
0," I'm curious, if you had been looking up to those sorts of players how that might have changed your mentality"
0, I know you are one that believed in the process and the rhythm of things and just coming into your own in your own time
0," I'm also curious if the next generation, if that may be impacted in any way seeing players break through at a later time in their careers"
0,"To be honest, I didn't really watch tennis in the TV that much"
0, I didn't really like it
0, I was preferring to play than to watch
0," But of course when I was starting be as a pro and trying to kind of play better and making some improvements for ITF and WTA, I watch some players like Kim"
0, She was kind of really playing a while
0, I like her as a person as well on the court and off the court
0,So it was one of them
0, I am not sure
0," I mean, of course that everybody is watching higher"
1, Like for us Serena maybe was the biggest probably person on our tour
0," Yeah, of course that everyone who's in the top are as idols for the next generation"
0,I am not sure
0," I mean, like I do feel that the women's tennis is very open right now"
0," It's just about the form, the mentality"
1, I think everyone knows forehand and backhand
1, It's about the key points and important break points and game points to save be really ready in the mind
1,"I do feel that the game, to be like good or great, is going for the shots and play aggressive"
1," But I see Angie, how she is great mover"
0, But even she has a chance she just going for it
1,"I just still do feel that the aggressive kind of part of the game, it's very important to get better and better"
0," Of course the movement, be fitter and fitter is no doubt very important as well"
0, She is showing everything in the game
0, She's very consistent as well
0, That's probably why she is that great right now
0,Another good match from you today
0, What do you think was the key to getting it done so efficiently
1,I think the key was really on my serve
0, Was couple of games really tight and she really went for it
0," From the return already she put the pressure on me, which is not nice of course on this kind of surface"
0,She really knew that she has to go for it and she did
1," That was kind of the tricky one probably, to keep the serve still and then wait for some chance to break her"
1," I mean, when I break her I did feel a little bit better, more relaxed, more confident as well"
0,The last game was really tight as well
0, I'm glad that my serve helped me again today
0,What did you make of the court
1," I spoke to Stosur and she said it wasn't that fast, but it wasn't that slow"
0, You seem to really like it and it seems to really suit your rhythm
0, Curious what your opinion is
0,I do
0," Yeah, I do like it"
0," I find it a little bit faster, to be honest"
0," I think that when the ball is bouncing it's really like not bouncing very high, so it's very low all the time"
1, I think that when you're really playing aggressive even the flat shots is just not really bouncing
0,So that's what I find pretty quick
0, Even on the serve when you hit the line sometimes it's really difficult to return it
0, Yeah
1, During the press conference of Zhang Shuai before she mentioned you're one of the top aggressive players in the world
0, She said one of the reasons is because you can finish the game before your opponent even picks up
0, How do you comment on your game with her
0, What will be your preparation for your next match on Sunday
0,It's for sure -- is it working
0,Good
0," First of all, I think it's very nice of her that she said it, that I do play well"
0, I did actually
0, I already explain the game of today
0,"For tomorrow, I need some good massage probably, good sleep as well"
0, Tomorrow will be ready for that match again
0," Doesn't matter who I going to play, but the finals are always difficult"
0, I love to play in finals
0, That's one of the reason as well
0,"I mean, I need to be ready 100%"
0," It's not the last match of the season for me so far yet, but on the WTA it is"
0," So I will really -- oh, boy, I'm tired"
0,Yeah
0,Who is going to be your rival we don't know yet
1, Can you just give some comment on either of Johanna and Elina
1,"I played Jo and Elina in Wuhan, both of them actually"
1," I did feel that with Svitolina I knew if I out the pressure on her, when she's under the pressure she's not playing that well as she is"
1,Of course it's always difficult to put a pressure on her because she is serving and returning well
0,Same with Jo
0, I don't really see bigger difference
1," I think with Jo it's more aggressive, trying to play more shots down the line"
0, That's probably the biggest difference
1,I think both of them playing aggressive
0, I think they going to try tomorrow
1,"Speaking of this being your last WTA match, with FedCup coming up, was this match any preparation for you, playing a Chinese player in China"
0,That's good one
0," Yeah, I think as I mentioned on the court after my match, it's always nice to play in China"
0, I know I do have a lot of fans here
0, It's great to play in front of them
0,"You know, playing Chinese is a little bit different and the crowd is never 100% for you"
0, It's never
0,But it was nice
0, They were really great
0," They support both of us and really clapping after every point, which is always nice"
0, It was full and was really great
0," I mean, the audience was really great today"
0,"But as preparation, yeah"
1, But I think in Fed Cup it's a little bit different
0," It's like a little more loudly, and in France it should be around 6000, 7000 people coming"
0,It will be great
0," We know how to play away, of course, but it's always better to play home for sure"
0, But that's how it is
0, They have advantage right now
1,Down a break in the first set
0, What do you think you did to turn things around and end up coming through pretty good in the end
0,"At the beginning of the match I didn't really feel the court, the ball"
0," It's always tough when you are not playing for two weeks a match, like a regular match"
0, Then it's tough for me
1,"But when I was 1-3 down I was telling myself, Be patient more and get into the rallies more, and then run"
0, Sweat more
0," Like this I start to feel the ball, feel the game"
0,Then it was 3-All and I start to be a little bit more confident
1," Also the first set gave me a little bit boost, so I was confident in the second"
1,At the draw ceremony Petra said it was interesting you got put together in the same draw because of Fed Cup in a few weeks
0," Have you spoken to her, and how are you preparing for each other"
0,We spend the whole party yesterday together
0, We really didn't speak about the match
0," Of course we said like could be a little bit different, but it is what it is and this is tennis"
0, So we have to deal with it
1,"Of course it's not easy because we are friends and we playing, like you said, Fed Cup next week"
0, But this is how it is
1," We can't say just like, We can't play because we are playing Fed Cup and we are friends"
0, But we will try to do our best from both sides
0, We will see
0,It's not the ideal group
0,This is your first time coming to Zhuhai
0, How do you like the city as well as the tournament
0,"To be honest, I didn't see so much from the city yet"
0, I have a day off tomorrow
0, I might go to see something
0,"But the site, the venue is amazing"
0," I have to say the courts and the organization, it's really nice"
0, But I can't say about the city much
0, Sorry
0,"But I have to say that you have a lot of green, so I don't see that much in Beijing or Wuhan"
0, So it's nice to hear the birds or whatever
0, It's very nice
0,I know players are asked a lot what it's like playing your friend
0, You hang out
1," For a teammate specifically though, you and Petra being on the same team, you're working together a lot in tennis, not just hanging out"
0, Does that give a different advantage or disadvantage
0," With the growing Czech contingent, might even have a whole dossier on upcoming players"
0,That's a good question
1," All the Czech players, we know how to be a teammates in the week where is Fed Cup"
0," Tennis is individual sport, so we know how to separate it"
0, Most of the time of the year you play for yourself
1,Three weeks in a year we are so close together and we are like really -- I can't describe it because it's like a routine for us that we are really doing everything together in the week where we play Fed Cup
0,"But when we have to play for ourself, then it's something else"
0," Of course it's a Czech player on the other side of the court, but this is a business"
0, We have to do our best
0," I try to do our best, she tries to do it as well"
0,So I think we are professional in that
0,You seem to have a bit of a struggle on court today
0, What was happening out there
0, Thank you
0,"Well, you know, for sure as a competitor it's tough, especially like you go out there, you play one hour, and it's done"
0,"But when I reflect on the match, I mean, she barely missed anything"
0, I think she was just on fire
0, She served well
0, She played well
0," Tactically she -- I mean, she took good decisions at good moments"
0,I never gave up
0, For sure it was just frustrating during the match
0, I was fighting until the end
0," Yes, sometimes it feels strange"
0," It's a weird sport sometimes because of that, because you feel ready to compete"
0, I practiced pretty well for the couple of days I was here
0,Then you end up playing against someone who is playing every shot in every corner and playing really well
0, So I give her all the credit for that
0," Well, I just feel sad I couldn't do more"
0,"On the other side I'm happy for her, because she is playing also here in front of her home crowd"
0," Well, she has been playing great all year long, too"
0, Probably confidence that she has is just growing
0,"Well, I think that's what happened"
0,How are you feeling physically at this point of the season
0, I know last summer there were some issues with fatigue
0," How are you feeling now, like anemia"
0,What
0,Last summer you were feeling some anemia
0,"Ah, last year"
0,"Yes, so I am curious this year how are you feeling"
0,This year I'm fine
0, It's definitely not anemia anymore
0, But otherwise for this year for sure it's the end of the year
0, The year has been pretty long
0, I started I think with two months or almost three months difference with other players because of my knee injury of the end of last year
0,So kind of I was really trying hard really quickly to -- for the first three months -- to get back on track
0," You know, with the competition around you try your best every day; you're so focused"
0, You lose as well so much energy doing that
0, It costs you a lot
1,"Some huge results got to me without expectations in Miami, and then huge disappointments by the Fed Cup"
1, Then again huge emotions the week after the Fed Cup with tournament win; then a great season of clay
0,"Then we added that tournament in Switzerland, a tournament in Gstaad"
0, Usually this was my holiday week as well
0,With an Olympic year I think it's tough sometimes
0," You have to be picky with schedules, because especially this year for me was really charged -- I mean, charged"
0," Yeah, many events going on for me as well as the top 10 -- counting as a top-10 player"
0, So I had many mandatory events
0,"Well, I think if I look back right now, today, 1st of November, I'm still in top 20 and thinking about every emotion things that have been going on this year, starting with the delay and everything"
0, I'm super proud of what I did already
0,This tournament is not over yet
0," Looking back at that, I think I can only take the positive side of it"
0," Even if it was tough, really tough after the Olympics, all the U"
0,S
0," Series, and then for me the Asian swing"
0,"Unfortunately, because I really love to be especially here in China"
0, But I wasn't able to be at my best because probably I was missing some rest and some preparation as well
0,So I still feel that my legs are not that quick as they were like one year ago or many things
0, This is also scheduling
0," Sometimes if you have the Olympics, another extra tournament which was not schedule at the beginning, then some other mandatory things, if you have status -- I mean, I'm learning"
0, It's only my second year finishing top 20
0, I am really proud of that
0,This is the thing -- finishing top 20
0," Not sure yet, but around, so it's enough for me"
0," But for sure I know now it's really the last push, and then I'm going to have two months almost to first recover, and then be really able to give my best at practice to be able to be ready for 2017"
0,Sorry for the long answers
0, Good luck
0,Is your name very popular name in Europe
0, You get to play another Timea next match
0, Talk about your game with Ms
1, Babos
0,"Well, so I have Hungarian roots and she's Hungarian, so it's really popular in Hungary"
0," But it's funny to say that, because now it's getting quite popular -- I mean, not super, super popular as Emma, but still quite popular in Switzerland"
0,"I'm almost too shy to say that, but maybe it's a little bit because of me actually"
0," Because it's true, many parents have been writing me to ask some autograph cards for their daughters, because let's say they had a daughter and they named her Timea because they just loved the name"
0,I really feel honored about that
0, In Switzerland there is maybe a little bit more Timeas than ten years ago
0, Thanks for the -- I mean -- I cannot speak anymore
0, Too much emotions
0," Yeah, thanks"
0, I been playing tennis for that
0, It's nice to let culture sometimes mix and name origins as well
0," Well, that's it for the little story"
1,"Well, so with Timea Babos, we do speak Hungarian together"
0," Well, we're friends, and, yeah, we know each other quite well"
0, It's going to be a tough one definitely
0,We played twice against each other but it was only on clay
0," You know, here the surface is quite different"
1," I mean, you have to be aggressive as well"
0, So probably it's going to be something totally different than on the clay courts
0,"Anyway, you know, I'm kind of pumped up because I don't like to lose"
0," Today I lost quite quickly, in less than one hour, so I'm not really happy about that"
0,"Definitely tomorrow -- yeah, like I said before, it's the last push, so I'm going to out there; I have nothing to lose; I maybe have the advantage that I played once on the court and I'm not going to be surprised anymore about how fast it is or -- yeah, about the small stadium or how it is"
0,I'm going to try definitely to do my best
0," You know, the best case is that I win and I can maybe stay here longer; the worst case I lose a tennis match and I'm going back home and going on holidays"
0,"You know, both of them I think is really like without pressure, because both of them are good plans for me"
0,Chinese questions
1,We know today's opening competition was very aggressive
0, Tomorrow we have more play
0," For the new player for tomorrow or for your team, your group, which one do you think is highly possible to come out of the group"
1,"Well, assuming that I only won two games today, even if I win tomorrow it means that Babos has to win against your country girl 6-Love, 6-1, which is going to be really tough"
0,"So for sure I would wish that I would go through, but the percentage of possibilities are really getting lower"
0," I'm not perfect in mathematics, but I can make one plus one, and so"
0,"I think and I hope for you, for this tournament, that Shuai Zhang is going to go through"
0," Not only because she's like your player, but as well because she's a great girl"
0, We played against each other this year at the Olympics
0, It was a difficult match; 7-6 in the third
0, Quite the opposite of the one of today
0,"But, yeah, well, still she is just really nice all the time with every player"
0, Very humble
0," Yeah, so that's why when you like a fellow player, then you wish her all the time all the best"
0," So that's what I wish her, so"
0,May the best win anyway
0,"Chinese fans give you a nickname, which is like teacher"
0, Every opponent against you later on will have greater performance
0, So are you their lucky star for them
0," Well, you know, I still prefer to win and to go far in the tournament because I'm a competitor, but it's a big honor to have nickname from Chinese fans"
0, I admire a lot your culture as well
0, So much wisdom as well
0, For sure so much different than what I grew up with
0,"But I think this is what is amazing about people and about world and about knowing people, is that you can, yeah, discover new things and get to know some new things and have more culture about many other things around"
0,"I know I can sound many times philosophic, but just beside of being a tennis player I think I'm a woman"
0, I'm not only a professional athlete
0," I'm really interested in life in many, things"
0,I enjoy being interested in many things
0," I think it makes my life -- I mean, for sure there is a tennis career, but there is a life after"
0," Hopefully it's going to be long, because I have many other things to discover"
0,"Yeah, I'm just -- I like to explore"
0, I wish the days would be longer
0," Not 24 hours, but let's say way more longer"
0," Then I could do tennis, other things, cooking, trying to learn Chinese"
0, It's tough
0, I'm improving
0," I know like five, six words"
0, That's it
0, Next year I'm going to know more
0,Just -- sorry
0, I just add
0, I did not answer 100% to the question
0," But to be quick -- try -- that, yeah, it's a big honor to get that nickname, but hopefully for the future I'm not going to be the lucky charm"
0, I will myself just being able to go further in the tournaments I'm playing
0,Good win for you today
0, What were you thinking down 4-1
0, How do you feel like you were able to turn it around so quickly
0,"I was like, Yeah, I'm going home, but I don't want to go as loser"
0," No, I mean, I was down, but I didn't really feel that I'm playing that bad"
0, I just felt that game was pretty close
0, I had some easy mistakes
0,So I knew that it's still in my hand
1, I just felt that she played a little bit aggressively than me in the beginning of the match
1," So I was a little bit trying to get the rhythm to play a little bit more aggressive, maybe a little bit longer rallies, that I can go to the game and be able to play"
0,That I think I did
1," I started to serve a little bit better as well, even I had more double faults that I wish"
0, But I still think that I find a way to kind of beat her
1, I played her in Wuhan and I was break down there as well from the beginning of the match
0,"I just probably knew that it's still not the end, so I was just trying to play point by point"
0, That was kind of the style of the match
0,You have difficult first half of the this year
0, You manage to get better and better
0, At which point you just kind of feel that everything is back on track
0,I'm thinking
0, You see it probably
0," No, I mean, I started to play better I think in MontrÃ©al, after Wimbledon when I didn't have the best result there"
1, I lost in the second round
0, It was very disappointing for me
0," I was really trying to get over it, to kind of not really get down from that loss"
0,"Then I started preparation and I came to MontrÃ©al and I did feel a little bit better, but it was still not there"
0, I think the important kind of time came in Rio when I started to feel confidenter more than before
0,I think it was kind of extra motivation play by the country
0," That I think gave me a little bit more confidence, more motivation, more energy, everything put into the game"
0,I think that was kind of the point when I started to play better
1," I played good in New Haven and US Open, and then I came to Asia and I really enjoy myself on the court as well"
0,"I miss that feeling for a couple of months in the beginning of the season, so I'm very happy that I found myself again on the court"
0," I do have this beautiful trophy, second trophy"
0," First one, Wuhan"
0, I'm really happy to have it for sure
0,"Even I drop from the top 10, I'm still very positive from the season"
1,You said your congratulations to Andy Murray on your Twitter from world No
0, 2 to No
0, It cost him seven years
0, You were a world No
0, 2 players yourself five years ago
0, Is achieving world No
0, 1 still a big goal for you or you're pretty relaxed about it
0,"I'm pretty relaxed right now, but, yes, I think I the No"
0," 1 spot is still missing in my career, have to say"
0,I think that without that goal I probably don't play tennis anymore
1," I still have a motivation to play better, to improve myself on the court, off the court, to win some tournaments, Grand Slams, and of course with that I'm going to try to be the highest I ever been"
0,I know how difficult it
1, We just saw how Angie did it
0, It's a great thing to have for sure
0," Yeah, I said him congratulations because I think it's a great achievement"
0," I think he did everything what is possible to be there, so I'm really happy for him"
0,We have a superfan question
0,Many congratulations
0,Thank you
0,Just one simple question
0, Will you have any special celebration tonight
1,"I wish, but we are flying home tonight actually because I'm playing Fed Cup next week"
0, But I think in the airport when we will have a time to wait for our plane I think it will be maybe a glass of champagne or wine or something
0,"I think that I will not really sleep easily in the plane, so who knows what happens in the plane"
0, I don't really -- I'm not really person who's planning the celebration
0, We will see
0,I think we need a glass of something
0,We know when you play a tournament you don't spend much time on the practice court
0, How hard are you going to practice in the off-season
0, Are you surprised that I'm not really practicing
0, I'm getting the questions very often
0,I think that in the end I didn't really have to spend like hours on the court to practice when I'm tournament
0," I think that when I'm playing the matches, that's the best practice what I can have"
0, I just had probably one day off between the matches and I hit actually
0,"So, yeah, for the off-season I'm planning to practice, yes"
0, I do
0," I'm starting with the fitness preparation for ten days or two weeks, and then I going to start with the tennis preparation"
1,"I'm starting playing in Hopman Cup, which is a great week for preparation as well"
1, We have a little bit longer season because of the Fed Cup
1,So this extra week in Hopman Cup will you very helpful to get ready for the first Grand Slam of the year
1,"Talking about the Fed Cup, so are you confident to win the championship of Fed Cup for your own country"
0, Now Czech has many strong players
1, You and Pliskova and also some male tennis players
0, So do you think that it is now a golden era for Czech tennis development
0,I think the tennis in Czech Republic has a huge history
1," When Navratilova played, all of them, we always kind of been strong for tennis"
0, I think we have a great time right now to be in the really good form in the women's side
1,"We still have Berdych on the men's side, but the women's side a little bit stronger right now, and that's why we playing final again probably"
0,Of course we should be confident to get the title for us again
0," I think we have a great team, and we going to do everything what we can"
0, We always love to playing
0," It will be great week for sure, and the weekend will be more special"
0,"Will be last two matches of the season, so everybody will just put everything what they have in the body and the mind and we will see"
0, Hopefully the luck will be on our side
0,Can you please comment on the event and the facility here and are you happy with them
0,"Yes, I am very happy"
0,"  I came here and was really surprised how everything is looking, so it was really impressed to me"
0, The city and everything around here is just really nice and I really enjoyed everything
0,I think that the people did a great job
0, We all have to just say thanks to them
0," Of course it's something more with the emotions to have this trophy, but I think everything was just perfect"
0, I'm really glad I was able to came and play
0,"As we all know, you had a great performance this year"
0, Do you have any goal in this tournament
0, Are you still looking for any breakthrough
0," What is your expectation next year, next season"
0, Thank you
0,Right now I'm at this event and my focus is to do the best that I can here
0, I hope to be involved in as many matches as possible and here until the very end
0, Obviously it's a very tough playing field
0, We'll see how it goes
0,"In terms of next year, I don't put any external expectations on myself"
0, I feel very process oriented and I look to improve myself every day
0, Unfortunately sometimes it doesn't get reflected in results
0,I love what I do and I love trying to get better every day
0, That's what I look forward to most next year
0,Quick start today and then got a little tenser from there
1, How did you mitigate the comeback from Stosur and get it done in two
0,"I definitely felt I started strong, but I think throughout the whole match there was not much in it"
0, We had a lot of close games and I really had to fight to kind of keep myself ahead there
0,"I think she played some really, really great tennis in parts"
0, I'm very happy to have come through that
0, Definitely wasn't easy; none of them are
0, I think it was exactly as expected: a tough game
0,"Yeah, I'm looking forward to getting another chance to play"
0,Zhang Shuai told us the other day that when she played a few tournaments in a row she felt physically tired
0, When she stop playing for a few weeks it's also mentally tough for her because she misses tennis and wants to compete
0, You haven't played a tournament for a few weeks
0, Do you feel excited to step on the court and hit the ball again
0,I definitely am very happy to be at an event that I'm actually playing at
0, I think that was a bit of a different experience for me last week
0,But it hasn't been too long
0," My last event was two weeks ago, and I'm very lucky about that"
0," I'm fit and I'm healthy and I'm here and looking forward to, yeah, to really try and play as much as I can seeing as this is my last event for the year"
1,Question about Andy Murray
0, He had the opportunity to become the world No
0, 1 this week
0, What do you think it means to your country
0," Well, I mean, honestly, it would be an incredible achievement for anybody"
0," Obviously being from Great Britain, yeah, he's already a hero at home"
0, There's not much left for him to do
0,"Yeah, he's definitely part of sporting history back home"
0, I think that's a given no matter what happens
0, He's definitely put himself into a great position to be able to achieve that
0, It's not an easy thing to do
0," I think it shouldn't be taken for granted what he has achieved so far, and the fact that he is in this position to get there, I think that's already incredible"
0,"So, yeah, hopefully he will finish strong"
0,Follow-up question on that
0, I am wondering if you know Andy very well
0," In your eyes, what kind of person, not a player, but a person is he"
0,I've recently gotten to know him better and better
0, I've actually known him for quite some time
0," He was training in Spain when I was there, so I have seen him around for quite a lot of years"
0,"It was only I guess recently, since the Olympics and Beijing, where I spent more time with him"
0, He's very funny and down to earth
0," He's incredibly professional, and I think that comes through in everything that he does"
0, That definitely reflects on court as well with what he's achieved in the sport
0,"Yeah, that's I guess all I can say"
0,You'll get a different kind of power in the next match: less spin and more flat
1, How do you adjust to someone who plays such a unique game on the women's tour right now as Stosur compared to someone perhaps more traditional or contemporary like Garcia
0,That's part of every tournament that I play
0, Rarely do I go into an event and play the same kind of player every match
0, There is always going to be some variety and some change
1,"I think I played Caroline twice this year, so we've been on court against each other"
0, I guess that will be in both our favors
0,Otherwise it's a 50/50 match
0, Going into it I will obviously have a chat with my coach and see what I want to be achieving out there
0,"Most importantly, regardless of any game plan or anything, it would be about competing the best I can and really trying to edge the bets in my favor on the court on the day"
0,You just talk about the professionalism of Andy
0," In Beijing, Zhang Shuai said, Me and Joanna, we're always the girls coming to practice very early"
0," Do you think of yourself as one of the hardest working girls on the tour, or just enjoy early practice session"
0,"I try not to compare myself to how other players train or how they, I guess, go through their careers"
0, Everyone is very individual and it's very individual what works for them
0,"But I definitely enjoy working hard and I do actually -- I'm more of a morning person, so I do like early mornings"
0, I'm under no false delusions
0, I'm fully aware that I need to put the time into my profession to get the most out of myself on the court
0,"So, yeah, I invest my time and energy into luckily something that I love"
0,Share some thoughts on ranking
0, Talk about what do you think about ranking
0," Like have you ever imagined you are in top 3 or higher, something like that"
0,"Well, I think it's what I dream of as a little girl"
0, I dreamt of being No
0," 1 in the world, being the best player out there"
0,I think you got to put also dreams aside a little bit separate just because you got to focus on the work and you got to focus on things that you can control
0," That's the effort and attitude that I approach my job, what I do"
0,"So quite honestly, I don't really think of rankings"
0," I don't measure myself by my ranking, nor my results, so I can't really, I guess, answer your question that well"
0,You said you don't measure yourself by ranking and results
0, How do you measure your achievement
0, Your own standard
0,"Well, no, I measure myself according to how I train and how I compete on the day"
0, I look to always make sure that every time I step out on to the court I give it all
0,"As long as I do that, I know I've given myself the best chance to have a good outcome"
0,So growing up you were probably one of the last generations who were looking up at other players and maybe seeing them peak and break through at 19 and 20
1, Now this next generation of juniors is looking up and seeing players like Kerber and Serena and even yourself
0, Of course you're still young yet
0," But seeing players breaking through at a later age - and I know you're personally about the process and gaining experience - do you feel like the next generation is going to adapt more of that philosophy seeing players break through later, and that that might help them in some way"
0,"I think it definitely is in their benefit to see that they're not late for anything, that they're not behind, to have that reassurance that, you know, sometimes it takes time and sometimes it really is just perseverance"
0,I think that's definitely a great thing for them
0," I personally definitely had to work a lot on not feeling like I was behind or not feeling that, yeah, that I was too old"
0, So I think definitely
0, I think that's a great thing for future generations
0,Just a lighter question
1, Bacsinszky showed off an opera mask that apparently you can get in the player lounge
0, Evidently there is a station where you can get calligraphy done and paint a mask
0, Is that something you have had a chance to do or if that is something you would like to do this week
0,"No, but now that you mention it, I will need to go and check this out"
0, I'm all about arts and crafts
0,"No, I haven't had the chance, but I probably will actually walk over there now"
0,Not so lucky today
0, How do you like your performance
0, How will you expect your next round
0,"Yeah, obviously I'm disappointed not to win, but I felt like it was a good match"
0, I thought she came out playing very well
0, From 4-Love down in the first set I thought we were really neck and neck
0," I thought I played well enough, definitely well enough to get myself back into the match"
0,"So positives I can definitely take from it, but of course you want to win"
0, So that's the unfortunate side
0,"For tomorrow, I feel I want to try and do the same things"
1, I am playing another player who is really aggressive and really goes for it and has a good serve
0,So I feel like I probably need to do similar things
0," If I can execute a little bit better, then I've got a very good chance"
0,"Yeah, no matter what, you have to try and play well"
0,"Curious, what do you make of Jo's rise through the year"
0, It's been quite a lot of improvements
0, Some of the changes you might've seen in her game as compared to seasons before
0,"Yeah, obviously she's had a great year"
0," She hasn't got herself to 9 in the world without playing well and consistently, and it started off in Australia this year"
0,"To be honest, before this year I had never really seen her play"
0," I don't have a lot to go on, but, I mean, I think when anybody really makes a dramatic improvement -- she's obviously playing with a lot of confidence now"
0, You can tell she's very deliberate and diligent with what she's doing
0, She seems very professional and I'm sure puts in a lot of time and hard work
0, That's obviously been paying off
0,Then you get a string of matches together and you can have some really great performances
0," Yeah, I can tell that she's obviously improved"
0," Yeah, she's a very good player"
0,What changes do you think you'll make heading into your next match
0,"Playing another player I have never played before, so that's I guess kind of unique these days out on tour"
1,"We've played against each other in doubles and I know that, like I said before, she plays aggressive tennis, got a big serve, really goes for it"
0, She hits the ball hard
0,So I guess in a lot of ways it's kind of similar to today
0, I need to no doubt get off to better starts
0, You can't be giving these girls head starts by four games and expect to be able to come back every single time
0,"If I can really just play how I want to be playing, which is like I did tonight, and get off to those better starts, then I think I have a chance"
0,I have a question about the generational shift
0," When you were growing up and getting into the game there was a sense that if you didn't peak or start playing top-level tennis at 19, 20 it would be difficult to break through"
1," Now this next generation is seeing players like yourself, like Clijsters and Kerber and Serena all playing very well into their mid- to late-20s and into their early 30s"
0, Curious how do you feel that mentality might have helped you growing up and seeing that people can break through at an older age and how you might feel the next generation might respond to this sort of shift
0,"Yeah, I think probably for the next generation you have a lot more hope"
0, You don't have to be this unbelievable talented superstar by the time you're 15
1," I think for a long time, maybe back 10, 15 years ago when Hingis was winning Grand Slams at 16, 17, if you're not at least top 20, top 10, you don't have a chance"
0,"That's really demoralizing, which I don't think is actually the case"
0, I think she was a big exception
0, You see this one person and everyone thinks that is the way it has to be
0, That's a very unique situation
0, Who knows if that can ever happen again
1,"I think with the way tennis is now, with it being a really powerful sport, everyone is aggressive, powerful"
0," If they're not, they're unbelievable movers and read the game exceptionally well"
0,I think it takes a little bit longer to put all these things together
0, I think in general people are getting bigger as well
0, I'm one of the shorter players
0, I'm certainly not tall
0, So I think takes longer to develop that now as well
0," 15, 16 years olds around the like that"
0,"Yeah, I think it's great that now that players now can play a lot longer into a career and really have a really long career and enjoy success for a longer period of time"
0,"Yeah, I think it's a good thing that this is happening rather than feeling you have to peak before you're 20"
0,"Some players at your age are retiring, but your still fighting"
0, What is your motivation
0,To try and get better
0," You know, I love doing what I do"
0, I really enjoy this as a career
0, When you retire there are a lot more retirement years than what there is playing years
0,"I think while I can do it, why not"
0," If I'm fit and healthy and can compete with the best in the world, that's what I want to do"
0,"First of all, congratulations on the win"
1," As we know, tomorrow you'll are playing Kvitova"
0," We all know that she is a powerful player, and you're more skillful"
1," Many, many years ago Davenport and Hingis, they were both representatives of those two kinds players"
0, Do you think your match tomorrow will be any resemblance of how they were playing before
0,"Well, thank you"
0," It's very, very strange that you compare Davenport and Hingis, especially to me"
0," I mean, it's I think a little bit too much because I don't deserve it yet"
0,"And, yeah, she's very, very powerful player, so I need to react really fast and look for opportunity"
0," Just stay in the moment, because you never know when the opportunity is going to come"
0,So I will try just to focus on each point and we will see
0," I mean, react fast is going to be one of the main goals tomorrow"
0,"Questions in English, please"
1,"So it was a tough first set for you, but you got off to a really big lead in the second"
0, How important was it to open up such a big lead after losing the first
0,"Well, it was really weird because I was not in the match"
0, I was completely somewhere
0," Somewhere maybe in my other semifinals, because this morning I said to my team that it's kind of strange because it's like my fifth semifinal in seven last weeks"
0,"It's very, very strange feeling"
0," I was trying to be focused in my match, but everything was not like together"
0," My legs, my brains was not connected"
0,"Well, after I just tried to relax and play my game, play and just enjoy, and I think it worked really well"
0, I was putting a lot of pressure and it was really worked for me in the end
0,What was going through your mind at 3-1 in the
0, Third
1, Jo has won so many three-setters
0, What did you do to turn it around in the end
1,"Well, it's good that you didn't tell me that she won so many three-setters"
1,"I also won a lot of three-set match, and I play good when the matches get long"
0," Well, I played really poor game on 1-2 because I was 40-15 up and then I just lost my focus and didn't serve well"
0," She came up with some good returns, couple of good returns, and then I was under pressure"
0,"Yeah, well, it was really poor game from me, but I was trying to say to myself, Come on; this game is very important, the return, to put pressure back and to try to get back in the game"
1,"And I think it really worked, because couple of returns I felt really good on my racquet, and then I think she was struggling a little bit with her first serve"
1, I was taking second serve as a good opportunity and it worked well
0,"Then, yeah, then I was just playing really good, playing deep, and everything was working well"
0, I was really moving well as well today
0,"You screamed after the match point, so what's the meaning for to you win this battle"
1,"Yeah, it means -- first of all, I screamed because I served for the match; second, that I won this tough, tough match"
0," Because she is playing really good now, and this year she had really, really amazing year"
0, She was quite confident
0,"So this win means a lot, like all other wins that I -- when I beat some players who is higher than me"
0," It's always really, really positive and great experience"
0, Even when I lose it's great experience to see what's going wrong
0,"So today was -- I cannot say that it's special win, but it's just one of the wins that brings me confidence, and also I can see that I am in a good level and moving step by step forward"
1,We know Konta is the top seed of this tournament
0, In this sense I think you also beat No
0, 1 again this year
0, You have already beaten the world No
0," 1, two world No"
0," 1, and the No"
0, 1 of this tournament
0, So what do you think is the key for you to defeat so many top players this year
0, What's the biggest improvement that give you such great confidence to do that
0,I think just being solid with my game
0," I mean, there is no special thing or something secret, but I just try to stay in the moment, to stay solid with my game, and to don't go unlike rollercoaster"
0," You know, like in the park there so close from here, you know, you have rollercoaster"
0, I actually been there yesterday
0,"Well, just being solid and stay mentally in the same level"
0, Then your game is going to be solid as well
0, But it's really tough
0, Only top players can do
0, Even I cannot do it all the time
0," Well, I try"
1,"Today in the third set I lost my focus a little bit and then came back, so it's good"
0, It's very important for me that I came back in a good moment
0, I didn't lose my focus completely
1," Then I would lose for sure, because Konta is the kind of player that when you give her opportunity she takes it straight on"
0,"All top players, when you give the opportunity straightaway they take and don't give you any free points"
1,Are you still cooperating with Justine Henin
0,Yes
0,"So in your opinion, what's the biggest favor she does for you"
0,"Well, she brings me a lot of confidence, first of all"
0," It's good that I have her in my team, so then she can give me opinion on my game"
0," You know, to get some feedback from such an amazing player, such a great champion who been on such a high level, to hear from her what is good in my game, what is not so good, what I need to improve"
0,So for me it's really special
0, She of course shares some experience how she felt when she was playing some tough matches and tough finals as well
0, Her experience means a lot to me
0," Of course not everything I can improve straightaway, but I try to improve little things"
0,"Of course preparation and being on court, all those things"
0, Step by step I try to change and to add some things
0,Great game today
0, Can you talk about what is your outlook for the next game or the entire week
0,"We just ended the game, and to be honest, I haven't had any time to think about the next game"
0, I'll be just enjoying today and I'll leave the next game when it comes
0, I'll be enjoying the night first
0,(In English
0,) How much does it mean to you after the year that you've had to be playing at home
0, What are the emotions that go through your mind
0,(Through translation
0,") I am very happy to win, actually to play in my home country and win the first game here"
0, I cannot say how happy I am about this
1,"It's been three weeks since the China Open, and actually during the three weeks it was a bit tough for me, because without game I kind of don't know what to do with my life"
0," Continuous game and competition does make me tired, however, I like playing even more"
1,We learned earlier this morning that Navarro just quit the game
0, What does that mean and how does that impact on your future performance
0,I did learn this fact 30 minutes before my game
0," To be honest, me knowing or not knowing this fact doesn't really change anything"
1, My opponent today was Bacsinszky
0, That's why I was only focusing on her
0,I would not focus on who I'm going to play next at this moment
0," I'm only focused on the game I played now, not the next one"
1,We know this is your second time playing with Bacsinszky
0," The first one was back in Olympics, and it was three sets, very close game"
0," Today winning, does it mean you know how to play her at this point"
0,"It's been three months since the Olympics by now, and I did see my progress in the performance"
0, I have to say this is not a coincidence
0, I am pretty confident in myself now
1,I just watched some of the video parts of me playing Bacsinszky during the Olympics and I can see that after that and after all the games in Beijing and Japan and Wuhan and Korea I really improved a lot
0," Compared to the Olympic Games, my win was a very close one"
0,I believe that if I can make the best out of my training I can play even better game
0, I also do enjoy my home court advantage here
0, It was great game for me
0,Thank you
0,(In English
0,) You spoke about Carla having to withdraw
0," How are you feeling physically at this part of the season, and how tough is it at the end of the season to be playing one more week"
0,(Through translation
0,) I am physically doing very well
0, After Beijing I took three weeks off and I well adjusted myself
0, I'm fully recovered now
0,I can say that I'm at my best at this moment
0," Also, that is one of the reasons why I played well"
0,"To be honest, Zhuhai is not my last tournament for this year, so I'm going to be playing well, and hopefully I can still enjoy all the games there"
0,This is the end of the season
0, How did you adjust physically
0," And since you're having more out-of-the-court activities, do they actually help your recovery"
0,My life before was kind of boring
0, I'm mostly a homey person
0, I usually spend my day between the courts and my room and sometimes at the restaurants
0,After doing my training in Tianjin and Beijing and U
0,S
0,", I usually stayed in chambers and never go out"
0," However, I do work with a lot of out-of-the-court activities now, especially for those promotional activities for tennis"
0,Sometimes I get to work with kids
0, I like kids a lot and I like sharing my ideas and knowledge with them
0, Their innocence is great enjoyment for me and nice substitution for my regular life
0, I get to meet a lot of people and get to know their background and experience
0,"For example, I used to think playing tennis was so tough; however now I know other jobs are even tougher"
0, Some people told me before that because I used to think that for you guys you get to sit in the office all day on a hot day with air conditioner
0, That's such a nice thing
0,"However, they in return would think that I get to play tennis all day long and such a great thing for him"
0, So the grass is always greener on the other mountain
0,"For me, I like to know more people, more stuff, that's helpful for my own career"
0,After the game you thanked for fans
0," However, there was an incident at the beginning of the game about some people in the audience kept moving"
0, Some fans agreed with you and they said they do need education for the fans
0, Some disagree
0, What's your comment on that
0,It was pretty chaotic and noisy at the beginning
0, I tried to accept the fact
0," However, my point is that if I lost the game because of the disturbance I don't think anybody will be on my side and told me you did a good job already and it's okay to lose"
0,I am a professional tennis player
0, I do need my points and prizes
0, So all of us are professional tennis player and require a quiet environment to play
0, That's simply the rules
0,"I believe my opponent was like me at the beginning of the game; however, she wasn't able to speak Chinese"
0, All she could do is to bring up the issue to the judge
0, There wasn't much the judge could do
0, She could only speak Chinese to the audience to sit down and be quiet
0,"So at the game I saw one person in the audience, and that person was transferring some kind of water back and forth three times"
0, I actually held back for a long while before I brought up this issue
0,"Also, I saw some volunteers are always moving there"
0, That's something that I don't quite understand
0, If you're somebody who doesn't know tennis much it would be okay
0, It's fine
0,"However, if you are a working volunteer, please do respect the rules"
0, This is something I couldn't quite understand
0,"Again, if I won -- of course I won the game and people would you agreeing with me; however, if I did lose, that would be the punishment on me for someone else's fault"
0,"Again, I don't think I should be the one to be blamed because I simply mentioned this is the rules and please respect the rules"
0,Thank you
0,"A little bit of a slow start, but you came back strong in the end"
0, What do you think was the key to turn it around
0,"Well, yeah, it was a really tough start"
0, I think she started playing really solid and I was bit in and out with my attitude and with my game
1,"But then I was just waiting for my chances, and I think in the second set I took my chances"
1,In the third set I think I create chance for myself because I was playing really good and felt the ball really good
0,"Yeah, in the end I think just playing solid was the key for me today"
1,"KiKi told us that you two never played before, right"
0,Yeah
1,"So we can see KiKi deliver many variations in her techniques, like dropshot, and also kept you running from side to side"
0, Is this part of the reason that maybe you need some time to adapt to her style
0," Because you two never play before, how did you adjust your strategy or emotion to turn around in the second half"
0,"Yeah, first of all, of course we never played each other before, but she was in the same situation"
0, I was not really thinking about it
0, I knew that she was going to bring like variations with her game because she's playing lots of doubles and she's really a good doubles player as well
0, So I was really kind of expecting this
1,"But, you know, it was not about how good she can dropshot or something"
1, I don't think she did many in the first set
0, I was just giving her too much time to open the court
1,"Yeah, I think this was the big problem in the first set"
0," Then when I had some time in restroom to think about what happened in the first set, I was like, Come on; you need to step the court and just try to do something with the ball, otherwise she's going to kill you"
0,"Yeah, I was trying to put pressure with my shots, and I think it worked really good"
0,"This is your opening match of the tournament, but it's such a long and tough one; you need two hours"
0," How will this long, tough match influence you in your preparation for the future games"
0,"Well, I expect long matches here because everyone is playing so well"
0," It's kind of normal because everyone have a high rank, so everyone is in the same kind of condition"
0, It's quite normal that there will be long matches
0,"Well, I have my fitness coach here so I'm prepared for long tournament, for long matches"
0, I will try to do my best to recover well
0," I don't know yet when I'm playing, but not playing tomorrow, so I have couple of days off to recover and go for next match"
0,Looking forward for next challenge
0,I think you were the first player to arrive here for the tournament
0, How much do you think that extra preparation helped you
1,When I lost the first set I thought it was the worst thing to do
0,"  Yeah, well I thought that it was bad idea to come here earlier"
0,"Yeah, but then I started to think differently"
0, I started to say to myself what to do on court
0,"Yeah, it's a bit strange because the balls and the court are completely different from last years"
0, It's so different
0, I think everyone is in the same condition and everyone is trying to do their best
0,Everyone is on such a high level here; everyone is adapting really well
0," It's quite normal because here is top players, so we're used to adapt fast and quick"
0,"Last two questions: You mentioned that it is difficult to like find training bases in your country, in Ukraine, and also get out of the country to find good sponsors, or also sponsor your training and playing matches overseas"
0, Did you also come across such challenges or difficulties when you were young
0, How did you overcome the challenges
0, Who give you the biggest help
0, This is the first question
0,Okay
0, I answer first
0," Well, I got really lucky because I have great support from my family"
0," My brother, he used to play professional as well, and was coaching me when I was young, until 12 years old"
0," Then I moved to the other city, which called Kharkiv in Ukraine where I got sponsored"
0, I'm still the ambassador of the place where I used to practice for many years when I was young called Superior Golf Club
0,"There is also tennis court, so I was there most of the time"
0, I got really lucky that I had this opportunity
0," Yeah, then I moved and I was practicing in the academy"
0,So my career was all the time like step by step
0, I don't know
0, Everything just was going not quick
0," Was not rise so fast, but then everything was like quite solid in knew my"
0, I think it helped me a lot
0," It was sometimes of course tough moments in my career, but I always had this support with my family, with my team"
0,"Yeah, I think I can call myself really, really lucky"
0,(Through translation
0,) Two questions: I know this year you've won in Rio and Beijing over No
0, 1 players
0, Does it give you any positive signal for your future competition with high-ranking players
0, Next question is: What's your goal for your next year's ranking
0,"Well, it was great experience for me to play in Olympics first of all, and then beating Serena as the player who is such experienced player and won so many things, I'm not sure I even dreamed to win so many titles as she has done"
1,"Yeah, beating Kerber as well"
0, She's really on top of her game for a moment
0, She had amazing year
0,"Of course it build me a lot of confidence and I was -- yeah, I'm just trying to take match by match"
0, It's always for me really -- I try to focus on each match
0," Of course there is some matches which means a lot for me, and I try to take positive things and I try of course always think what I can improve more"
0,Because I think in those matches which I won against them it was really -- I was playing really well and keeping my emotions on a high level
0," That's why I think this was the key in that game, in that moment"
0,You had a really good win over Vesnina a few months ago
0, Curious if you will do anything different before that match to maybe start maybe a little bit faster and be prepared for that next match
0,"Yeah, I will try to prepare well, to recover, first of all"
0, She's of course really confident I think at the moment after winning doubles in Singapore
1, It's a big thing for her and for Makarova as well
0,I think she would come really confident into the match
0, I will try just to stick to my game
0, I will sit down with my coach and speak about the match
0, Probably he will see what I've done good in New Haven where I played her
0,"Yeah, it's a new match, new challenge"
0, There will be new opportunities
0, I will try to create of course opportunities for myself
0," Yeah, I will do my best"
