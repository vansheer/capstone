Bedroom object detector with explanation for English learners who speak Mandarin


## OVERVIEW
The purpose of this project is to build a custom object detector off Tensorflow2, together with an English-Chinese dictionary-like database, to assist beginner English learners who speak Mandarin Chinese. <br>
Ideally, the final product will be a smart phone app that can help users identify the English names of objects around them and then offer further explanation, so that users can quickly learn more English words without having to look them up.


## WNY THIS?
I was in English teaching for 12 years in China prior to data science. One of the most frequently asked questions was: "My vocabulary is limited. What can I do?" If I think harder, that can easily be the top question. <br>
The way I think about building vocabulary is that you need to get into context. One can certainly grab an Oxford Ditionary and start memorizing every word in it. But for beginner English learners, I would always recommend to start small and go through things they see everyday. It's like the rule of thumb for writing for beginners: write something you know. If you see, use, touch, sit on or talk about something on a daily basis, there is a greater change you will remember what it is in another language. So my #1 suggestion to my students was: name everything around you until you know them like the back of your hand. <br>
With that suggestion comes a dilemma: I know what I know and I don't know what I don't know. As a life-long English learner myself, I constantly encounter things or concepts I know in Chinese but not in English, and looking them up doesn't necessarily guarantee the accuracy, if I can look them up at all. <br>



## WHAT DATA?
For this phase I'm only focusing on common objects in the bedroom. I took a few photos of the two bedrooms in my apartment, and found some more off Google and Craigslist (which is very helpful because the bedroom photos from the housing section on Craigslist are very diverse, all kinds of sizes, angles, backgrounds, lighting conditions, etc.)<br>
