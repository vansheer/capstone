Domain specific keywords/terms highlighting model <br>
Domain: tennis tournament press conference (English/Chinese)


## OVERVIEW
I'm trying to train a custom name entity model with spaCy for a specific domain to help Chinese/English interpreters prepare for work. 



## WHY THIS?
When I was a conference interpreter before the pandamic, one of the time-consuming tasks for me and many of my colleagues was (and still is I believe) to get familiarized with specific domains. <br>
As freelance interpreters, we work with clients in all fields. Whenever we work with a new client in a filed we don't know much about for the first time, we will need to spend days on documents that client offers us for preparation, mostly for two things:
- Going through everything to make sure we don't miss anything important **that we don't know**
- Google things that we don't know

#### And the problems are:
- Going through everything takes a lot of time. What we need to spot is usually new words and/or domain specific terms, and everything else should be generic. But we cannot skip any part since we don't know where those new words and terms are. When there are hundreds of pages to read, a big portion of the time is wasted.
- Googling things is another big pain if the interpreter lives in Mainland China for political reasons. It's not only time-consuming, technologically demanding and even a bit unsafe.

So, a custom name entitiy model with sufficient entities and proper visualization can help address both problems.
